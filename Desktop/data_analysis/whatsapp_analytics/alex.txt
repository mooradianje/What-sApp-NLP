 Paid 99 cents to upgrade my caption app to get white lettering. Totally worth it
 Haha awesome
 <Media omitted>
 I love that band's name. Perfectly chosen
 <Media omitted>
 The girly cursive really makes it haha
" Hahaha heavy booyah referencing today, awesome"
" Haha I just talked with my mom and she said she can get stuff to grill for dinner and she has a ton of eggs from the neighbors. Other than that if you guys wanted to bring stuff for lunch like cold cuts, bread, etc. and other stuff to go with eggs for breakfast like bagels and whatnot, that would be cool. Also some snacks and and a water bottle or two for hiking could be good."
" If you're going to bring it, you should probably start thawing it in the fridge. It'd be doable if thawed"
" Haha probably better to just start thawing tonight, faucet defrost was less than optimal"
" Yeah, I just asked my mom if it would be possible and she said definitely"
 <Media omitted>
 <Media omitted>
 Google says it should be ok
 Oh Jesus haha
 'So sorry... Oh argh uh... So sorry'

 Felt like it was again germane to the convo
 When exactly did you get that turkey?
 We should be ok then

" Here's the trail guide for hiking Killington, could be good http://www.killington.com/site/mountain/trail_map/hiking/S15_TrailMap_Hike_web.pdf"
 There's also the healdville trail that goes up Okemo
 http://www.vtstateparks.com/pdfs/okemo_sf_trails.pdf
 Here's some other ones near okemo
" Haha just noticed that in the last link, the hike that we did last time is listed as 'aggressive'"
" This one goes by some sweet cliffs, about 2.5h round trip "
 About a half hour drive from ludlow
" Haha yeah, full disclosure, it does involve doing over 1000 vertical ft. I figure though that if it gets strenuous, it won't be like we're in a rush, so we could take our time, have snacks and rests and stuff"
 Yeah we're gonna clown all over this trail
 I'm planning on heading up in the early afternoon around 2 or 3 from Storrs
" Just thought of another thing for VT. If you guys could bring sleeping bags and pillows, that would help minimize the number of sheets to wash at the end of the weekend."
" You sure that won't be too much? We're only there for two dinners. My mom already made meatballs, sausage and peppers and she picked up steak tips. She'll likely have a batch of chili too she said."
 I still got mine. I'll bring them up
 Tons of stuff here
" No worries, we're pretty stocked up here. Could always bring some beer. Found out that the taps have been shut down while my dad's away. We still have a good amount of beer though here"
" Yeah, apparently he was having some problems with one of the controllers and didn't have time to get it all straightened out"
 Sounds good

 That one's based on the Simone de Beauvoir comic that you guys posted
 Can't think of a good pun name for it yet
 Think I'm gonna go with 'Simmeown de Beaupaws' for the second set
" I also got a kick out of the 'do it motherfucker' line, super dark humor haha. I have to agree with your overall sentiment, Wu. We're really #blessed"
 <Media omitted>
 Just realized that that comic is multiple pages! I'll have to check out the rest. Seems pretty heavy tho. Reminds me of that time Mike Mitchell watched the movie Click by Sandler et al. and was moved to subsequently tell everyone that he appreciated them. I think he even called his mom.
" Changing subjects, I just gotta vent real quick about some TA bullshit. Yesterday, the professor that I TA for tried unknowingly (because her math is weak sauce) to assign me a grading load the violated my contract hours. I made an excel sheet and did basic hours accounting to prove to her that she had indeed violated it. Totally QED'd her. But now she's acting like she can still negotiate with me. I'm supposed to show my calculations to the other TAs tomorrow to make sure they agree, which as I see it doesn't matter. If they don't, I'm gonna straight go to the department head and if that doesn't work to the union if I have to. I don't get what the fuck she don't understand about contracts. Fucking academics sometimes, man... Sheeeuuuttt"
" That exactly what I'm doing. Haha I'm not budging an inch. Told her today that as she has it now, either she is violating my contract or the students' papers that I grade get roughly half (turns out that the actual fraction cus I did the fuckin math) the attention that those of their peers get. Up to her"
 Haha that photo is great
" The Large Hadron Collider is gearing up for its next experiments, 'Run 2.' As a promotional thing, CERN is doing a series of videos where 'experimental physics meets experimental music.' They recently released this video with Deerhoof: http://youtu.be/tZqQGbSnSTA"

 Hahaha pretty dark humor
" Sheeuuut, that's a sweet-looking car, Butze"
" Haha, looks like the entirety of 'the weird' went. That's cool though, would you really want to go to a wedding? They've never been my favorite, and less so the less I know the people"
" You guys see that noob at uconn who tried to bring booze into the union, proceeded to get into a verbal and finally physical altercation with the union manager, and then got arrested?"
 Here's the video of it. http://www.barstoolsports.com/barstoolu/encore-of-drunk-uconn-kid-trying-to-get-some-jalapeno-bacon-mac-and-cheese-at-the-student-union/
 There's a breakdown of the action too
" Some guy at the very end goes, 'ooooo-eeee' kind of like Mr. poopy butt hole"
" Hahaha yeah, that was one of my first thoughts too, the YouTube video of it has 119,878 views"
" Haha, thanks guys!"
 Still makes me laugh each time
 Hahahaha epic

 Dude does a bit called 'how my day sounds towards the middle that I couldn't stop laughing at
 Actually it's closer to the end of the clip
 Are you getting closer to buying something?
 With the toy show too!? Can't wait!
 Hahahaha
 Haha awesome
 <Media omitted>
" Haha If you look closely, you'll see that it's holding a beer mug. My dad had it carved by this guy in Chester. You know the house with the huge mailbox? That guy. He's also made a bunch of beats for Steven Tyler. The guy's name is, I shit you not, Barry. Barry the bear-carving guy. He does it with a chainsaw"
" Wow, what a catch"
" Most holiday shoppers probably feel that way. I was feeling like that the other day. Luckily I happened to chance upon the movie Flash Gordon plying on the TV, which cheered me right up. Have you guys seen that one? It's hilarious. Maybe even better than Conan the Destroyer"
" Yeah, the hero has no super powers, he's just the quarterback for the New York Jets. He uses some of his football skills to fight aliens"

" Cool, small world"
 Haha perfect
 <Media omitted>
" Maths, it's pretty sweet"
 Hahaha exactly
" Each line in the lower half corresponds to a half circle in the top half. The diameter of each circle corresponds to the interval from 0 to 1 on the circle's corresponding line. A line is drawn from each circle's midpoint to a point outside of the interval from 0 to 1. Where that line intersects the circle, a line is drawn from the intersection to the circles diameter such that that line and the diameter are perpendicular. That process, which maps a point outside of the interval to exactly one point inside the interval can be repeatedly for all of the infinite points on the real line outside of the interval. Therefore, the mapping is one to one and the infinity of points inside the interval is exactly equal to the infinity of points outside of the interval (in mathspeak, they have the same 'cardinality'). For each half circle, I've drawn 4 example mappings. Then I repeat the drawing using the previous drawing as the 0 to 1 interval is the next. That way the nesting of Infinities becomes more obvious."
 Haha 'team feelings'
 <Media omitted>
 It's a little blurry. It says #buttstuff
 I think it just might be
 Is #buttstuff a movement?
 Haha was wondering why it was a pretty professional sticker and also why it was a hashtag. Was butt stuff trending?
" Hahaha, amazing"
 You guys feel like coming up to VT again for New Years? I'll be up there and you're all invited
" Haha awesome. Butze, could you extend an invite to Rob too"
" Great, should be a lot of the same group this year, so it should be pretty fun again"
" Haha, excellent use of 'majesty'"
 Have you guys seen the video of bill burr explaining how to bake a pie crust? Hilarious
 http://youtu.be/LoWCMzHWlRk
" I was thinking the exact same thing, 'Go Fuck Yourself: Cooking with Billy Red Face'"
 Haha the very last sentence of the article is perfect
 <Media omitted>
 It's for this secret Santa ornament swap that we do on my mom's side of the family. So she's not even going to know who it's from as she opens it. Can't wait
 Check out this blurb for Bill Burr's interview with Jimmy Fallon
 <Media omitted>
 His rant is great too. Can't wait for his series to come to Netflix on Friday
 Hahaha
" Amazing, love when the lady was like 'we got the lyrics to Rudolph' and X was like 'bitch, please! I know the damn lyrics! *bark *bark'"
 Haha 'tizzugs'

 Hahaha just read this string of messages. That custom bitmoji is hilarious
 <Media omitted>
 hahaha
 <Media omitted>
 these are pretty fun
 Still laughing at dave's description of Jimmy's mr. Poopybutthole
 So when you guys coming up to VT?
 <Media omitted>
 Nice
" If all you guys could just bring a towel, pillow, and a sleeping bag. Most likely won't need the sleeping bag, but just in case."
" Don't worry about food or drink, we're gonna have a ton of stuff"
 <Media omitted>
" Sorry to hear about your Grandma, Jim. We'll definitely have another trip up to VT in the new year. My parents also just recently bought a house on the beach in Madison, CT, so we'll all have to get together there one of these weekends"
 Hahaha
" Sheeeuuutt, dat ass tho haha"
 When are you guys coming up today?
 Sounds good
" When you guys get here, park up in the second driveway"
 <Media omitted>
" What do you guys think of making a beer tasting app? It's basic function would be to let people join a 'tasting chat' like what we have here in WhatsApp, then the group would enter the names of beers as they try them and the group could rate each one as they drink. The app would tally the scores and keep track of everyone's tastes. There could even be a means of sharing 'playlists' of beer lineups for tastings. You could get other users to recommend good tasting lineups like 'great VT IPAs' for example. Or you could even get master Brewers to design playlists that highlight what they are trying to accomplish with their beers. There could also be a function that works like that community playlist app that Rob and Butze had at that party at Rob's house. Butze, would this be possible to program? We could get Rob involved too."
" Cool, sounds good. Dave, thinking more along the promotions line, imagine if you could walk into any of those huge beerfests and the app would give you and your friends possible tasting routes through the festival to travel so that you could strategically go about your tasting experience. All the while you can rate the beers in realtime with your group."
 Wasn't any bubbling so my dad took a quick peak under the lid. he said that despite the lack of bubbles it looks like something is happening.
 We should have drilled another bunghole for checking temperature. A 'thermobung' haha
 Haha

 Dang that looks good! You made that!?

" Not sure, my parents have been in CT this week. Hopefully it's going well"
 Found a great intro book to mathematical logic for free online. Just google 'how to prove it pdf' and it'll come up
 Or if public transit becomes good enough so that people don't feel like they lose any autonomy by choosing it.
 <Media omitted>
 What's some good music to do math to? Already exhausted the Com Truise catalogue
" Oh yeah, nice, I had forgot about Tycho, thanks! Thanks for the playlist too!"
 Derive up to the club with my ceiling missing
" Sweet, bout to get mad rhombus up in here"
 Seems to be! My dad just started the secondary fermentation. Hopefully it comes out well. My uncle Pat's also for a batch going. He bought kettle and a fermenting tank after we did the Mutt's Nuts batch in VT
" Yup, the two batches should be done around the same time too, so there's gonna be a lot of beer to drink"
" Haha awesome, just heard his radio show on Monday. He kept playing this band called Soft Moon. Even did 3 songs of theirs in a row"
" Anyone know an efficient algorithm or ideally pre-written program for finding shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a network where the links between nodes are weighted?  They have something like that for traffic, Jim?"
 What's the software you use? Can it handle 1000's of nodes?
" Nice, sweet name haha"
" Cool, i'll look into those and see what UConn has licenses for. Thanks."
" Yeah, I mostly worried about computation time. I will have relatively large spatial graphs and I want to couple the flow through multiple graphs, so I might need to solve them multiple times. Python's a good idea though. Probably has some parallel options"
" I can represent it in any form I want. I have the fundamental data as ASCII files. Just found something called NetworkX for Python, which could be helpful"
" Cool, ok, I'm going to try some options out and see what I have access too. Thanks for the infos."
 <Media omitted>
 I think just 2 more weeks until drinking
 You guys wanna do a trip up to VT in a couple weeks when they're done?
" Sheeuuutt, I have to go to Long Island that weekend to do experiments. Would the weekend after work?"
 We can always do it the week after that. It's not like it goes bad in a couple weeks
 Looks like some kind of high tech station for j'in it
 Install a toilet hole in that recliner and baboom problem solved
 Nothing. But. Net.
 Hahahaha
 Works for me
" I think I just had one of the nerdiest thoughts of my life. Was doing some math for this model I'm making and I thought to myself: 'Ah Math, the Sam to my Frodo. At times, I resent him, but in the end, I'll be glad he's always there.' Combo math and fantasy literature nerddom."
 Hahaha
 Haha that is pretty great.
 Hahaha
" Damn, that looks good!"
" I'm going to be in Boston visiting Kelly this weekend. Dave and Sean, will you guys be around?"
" Alright, cool, I'll link up with you, Butze, via text once I know exactly when I'll be up there."
 Hahaha we could take over the ball pit
 It'd be especially hilarious if they ask you to spell that please haha
 You guys remember this classic bear grylls clip? https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=L6ytCxm62fk
" Then in subsequent textbooks written by other authors, there'd be chapters called Mooradian's Dog Washing Model"
" There'd be engineers who would have difficult traffic problems and others would consult them saying things like, 'have you tried dog washing, I.e., Mooradian's method?'"
 Pump and dump does though. Just in case you were considering that as an alternative
 The 'nutnutnutnutnut nutsack in da asshole'
" I'm in. On the 12th, right?"
 Definitely bring the turkey. Bout to be a straight up feast.
 Touching lives one dick at a time
 Why do you need to wear a respirator mask?
 Hahaha loled at the Dutch boy reference
 You guys ready to get weird this weekend?
 When are you all going to arrive? I'm going up tomorrow morning and am going to work from up there for tomorrow afternoon and Friday
 Nice
" Sweet, my mom also made chili and some chicken salad. What we typically lack during these weekends is fruits and veggies. Although, I think my mom usually has a box of lettuce and spinach handy."
" Yeah, that's probably true"
 Looks like it'll be good weather this weekend. Could potentially do a hike or at least play some cornhole in the backyard
" Haha great, we can see if the snow is melted enough. Should be good though"
 Might be a little cold for kayaking.
" Butze, your car had 4wd, right? It's mud season here and the road's a little dicey at the moment. My CRV makes it fine, but you have to be a little careful. Dave, let us know when you get to downtown Ludlow and we've arranged for you to be able to park your car at our neighbor's closer to where the road is still paved. Jimmy is your car 4wd? If not, you can also park at our neighbor's. Just let us know when you're close."
" Yeah, I'm not sure how bad it is now, but during the rain yesterday, it was approaching 6in deep chocolate River. Dave and Jim, just let us know when you're close and we'll meet you at a place to park. Butze, you should be good to go."
 The landline at the house is 802 975 0586. The cell service in downtown ludlow should be fine. Let us know when you're to the stoplight in town and we'll head down the hill to our neighbor's as you head up
" Cool, see you guys in a little bit"
" Jimmy, Dave's car made it up the hill. It's up to you if you want to try, but it's not problem to drop your car off at out friend's down the hill. Let me know"
 Ok cool
" Thanks for posting the recipe, Butze! Definitely going to try it out. Could you post the pumpernickel one? Think I'm going to try to do that one to go with reubens"
" Awesome, thanks!"
 So soon there'll be a AI agent with a nerdy voice giving a YouTube tour of his minecraft world? Can't wait
 The pumpernickel bread recipe calls for 'cornstarch wash' and cites a sidebar on pg 51. Could you snap a photo of that and send it?
 Hahaha
 <Media omitted>
" Haha, his face is truly off putting"
 <Media omitted>
" I got the caraway seeds at price chopper. They were with all of the spices. Good luck with the gluten free loaves, Wu! You doing those for a date, right? Even if they come out badly, it should still be fun. It's the 'striving that must suffice' haha"
" The only thing I did differently from the recipe was I made my own caramel color. That's probably why. Instead of as a powder, I had it as a liquid, so maybe I should have used more to get it darker."
 This is the caramel color recipe that I used
 <Media omitted>

" Butze, are you in Tennessee? Or is that in Boston?"
" Nice, was probably some good eatin there I bet"
 You on a job interview? Just some vacation?
 The south really does have some redeeming qualities after all
 <Media omitted>
" Thanks. As it turns out, it was slightly underbaked in the middle. Still dialing it in. Also, you guys might find this amusing. I'm parallelizing my Matlab for that network problem I'm working on and it basically involves switching the command 'for' to 'parfor'. Pretty far from the metal."
 Haha amazing and simultaneously horrifying 
 Thanks!
 Just started Twin Peaks. Love the dialogue. The FBI guy is great
 Sheeeeuuuuuutttt
" Jim, this shortest paths problem I've been working on has brought me to a big data problem. I now have the algorithm so that it can do the calculation graphs with 3-4 thousand nodes and 4-5 thousand edges. The whole calculation takes about 1 min. If I move up to 10 thousand nodes, however, the matrices no longer fit into my computer's physical memory and it freezes. I need to allocate and call memory more efficiently. Any keywords I should look into for solutions? Butze, you have any experience with this?"
 That's a good idea as a relatively simple first hack at it. I think I can definitely drop some precision.
 Thank you
" Yeah, my WhatsApp does the same thing whenever it updates. It stops giving notifications of messages. I'm definitely going to try Jim's idea of more carefully assigning my data types. Yeah, the problem is that I ultimately need to calculate an N x N matrix where N is the number of nodes whose values depend on 3 other N x N matrices. Each entry i,j of each matrix gives me a certain property of the shortest path from i,j if there is one. I'm doing all of the calculations locally in parallel (the iterations of a for loop are evaluated competitively by the parallel workers) and in order to do that Matlab replicates all of the matrices for each of the workers. When that happens the physical memory gets used up really quickly. Matlab had some documentation for this problem that offers a bunch of potential solutions. I was seeing if you or Jim may have known of one off hand to help me down select from the list."
 The values in each matrix are currently 64bit floating point numbers. The algorithm for shortest paths is built in to Matlab and returns a shortest path tree. The part I came up with is basically a depth first search algorithm where the entire tree is traversed and properties of each edge are summed and stored along the way to get all of the shortest path's properties.
" Yeah, geometric properties of the edges"
 Right now I'm working on making them all 32bit
 Then I might mess around with distributing the matrices or creating what Matlab called a 'data store' or using a function they have called 'mapreduce'
" Yeah, I already have them represented as sparse. Currently there are a lot of infinities in the entries. Maybe I can convert those to 0's as I go. Luckily the values range from 1 to infinity so I can unambiguously reassign zero to any infinities"
 In Matlab they have a function called sparse that 'squeezes all of the 0's out of a sparse matrix to save space'.
" Yeah, my Matlab is 64 bit. I'm actually running on a super high performance computer with 12 CPUs and 24GB of RAM."
 Yup
 Those are all very good ideas. I'm going to try them out. Thanks!
 <Media omitted>
 Hahaha
" Awesome, please do share that recipe when you've got it dialed in. As I was reading through the ingredients the thought 'nothing but net' passed through my mind."
 <Media omitted>
" Jim, that meal just screams 'ring of fire'"
 Hahaha
" Have you been seeing this girl long? I'm definitely no expert, but it can take some time to start to care for somebody just like it takes some time to feel at home in a new house."
" Well said, Sean. I've also gotten help in the past. I think there's a reason why our group identifies with comics like 'depression parkour'. I don't mean to imply that any of our experiences can be equated exactly. Each person's experience is unique. How's your mindset now, Dave?"
" Butze's probably right. Nothing to lose doing that. Dave, you should give yourself some more credit for just going to the formal in the first place. That type of stuff can be so overwhelming and exhausting. How do people actually enjoy those things? It's a difficult date night, especially if you just started seeing someone. I definitely would have felt extremely uncomfortable. So definitely give yourself some credit for stepping out of your comfort zone and going at all. Takes some cajones just to be present for something like that, in my opinion at least."
 <Media omitted>
" Just to lighten the mood for a moment. Also, WhatsApp just notified me with that message that they now have 'end to end encryption', which kinda sounds like a butthole reference."
" That's a really great article. It's amazing how much of the discussion overlaps with Bill Burr's comedy. I feel like he has bits that hit on all of the nuances that were mentioned in the article. Also made me think of this great song called ugly cherries I just heard by this band of two drag queens called PWR BTTM. The singer said he wrote it about his struggle to fully accept his being queer and his desire to express himself through drag culture, but if you listen to the lyrics in the context of that article, they pretty much hit dead on how it feels to not be able to express an important part of your being, whatever it is. Kind of like Billy Budd. You guys have to read that in high school? The singer also said that he was thinking of that adage that if you say you're alright enough you'll be alright and whether it could actually be true. So there's a great part where he basically is shouting he's alright in a tone that sounds strained and doubtful. Also there's a face melting guitar lick in the song. Thought-provoking stuff http://youtu.be/KX_tBWLmr1s"
" Butze, how long did it take for the wild yeast to colonize that stuff?"
" Wow, pretty cool"
 I'll be able to make it too
" Looks like regular sandals, are they just really comfy?"
 Haha that group definitely knows how to get weird
 Hahaha all the best things involve sonic costumes I guess
 Ahh that's right
 I'll definitely be there
" I should be free to come up earlier and stay for a little while on Sunday. I'm going to stay at my sister's. Normally, my sister's condo would be a good option as a place for all of us non-Bostonian to stay, but this time Kelly has a couple friends visiting for the weekend, so with them and me the pullouts will be full."
 <Media omitted>
" Sean and Jim, Kelly and some of her friends are planning on going to the Arnold Arboretum tomorrow from around 1130am to 4pm. I was probably going to meet them there on my way into the city if you guys wanted to come too."
" Ok, cool, figured I'd float it out there just in case"
" Dave, I listened to a couple songs from that band you recommended. Very chill. I've only listened to a little bit but it's like a chill-skype-wave fusion"
" Nice, also I've meant to tell you guys that satellite radio recently broadcasted a live com truise concert. Dude's really hitting the big time"
 Hahaha
 Hahaha love when he just shouts the names of his friends
 <Media omitted>
 <Media omitted>
 Going to be some epic meals
 Hahaha just got the reference
" Not sure when it'll be done. God that's trippy, Jim haha"
 That shaping tho
 Hahaha
 Hahaha that's awesome
" So much nostalgia in so few words. You got kazaa, music videos, linkin park"
 Hahaha
 Hahaha
" Unfortunately, I'm going to be in San Francisco that weekend for experiments otherwise I would definitely be in attendance"
" Speaking of that, SNL parodied nu metal last week, pretty funny https://youtu.be/QO0J8VEO6u8"

" Sheeeuutt my WhatsApp wasn't updating notifications again. Congratulations on the new job, Sean!"
 I'm out in San Diego for a conference this weekend
" Haha lol-ed thinking of actually saying 'this poopy butthole is hungry!' to an upper management type. I don't think they can fire you for something like that though. Did I tell you about that guy who was wiping with ass gaskets at work and then putting them back in the gasket dispenser? Couldn't fire him because he had some kind of religious reason for doing it. You just have to say Mr. PB's a religious figure to you, Dave"
" Haha, I don't know now that you mention it if ass gasket is widely accepted nomenclature. A friend of mine once overheard a small child in a public restroom call them ass gaskets and the term just caught on haha"
 <Media omitted>
 I think just stuffing them back in. I imagine an absolute nightmare scenario for a germaphobe reaching for the protection of a gasket only to be betrayed
 Hahaha
 This actually occurred at a friend of mine's company. She works in HR and it was reported to them. At around the same time there was also a mystery person leaving dookies in paper bags around the office. Separate offender who was ultimately fired once discovered.
 They say acts of that nature usually come in 2's hiiiyyooo
 And where are you going again?
 Nice! Gonna be a sweet adventure
 Probably keeps you regular too.
 So I'm going to India next Tuesday for a week and I've been trying to prepare as best as possible. During my researches I came across this hilarious video of how to use an eastern latrine that I would highly recommend: https://youtu.be/dKkryfdtMNQ
 It's part of a series of instructional videos on how to crap around the world.
 So dark and so funny
 Grand Apizza on Main Street is great pizza and pretty standard prices. The simple sauce and Parmesan apizza is my favorite
" Hahaha, looks like that could be it"
" Also, Butze, you're yolo-ing so hard right now. Looks amazing!"
" Butze, that picture you posted of a goat on Idaho is pretty much exactly as I would imagine that state haha"
" You guys are pretty much outlining the main theme of my dissertation, efficiency versus creativity. Efficiency is typically associated with uniformity and limited interaction whereas creativity depends on the interaction of a diverse set of things, whatever they may be. In the most optimal case, there's a balance where efficient structures facilitate creativity. The bronchioles in the lungs are a good example. Straight, uniform tubes branch and decrease in radius efficiently transporting air to oxygen absorption sites, which are exactly inefficient with respect to moving air, but amazingly effective at getting oxygen because their surfaces are so nonuniform and textured. It's all about efficiently bringing diverse sets of things together in a productive manner with minimal loss of each entity's unique character along the way."
 Blew my mind too. That little piece of math that James showed me lead to a whole derivation that made the lungs thing clear to me
 Literally
" The food industry also gets the benefit of efficiency with respect to food sanitation. Just came back from India where the food is amazing, all 'home-cooked' style, but it'll give you horrible shits. I was like a faucet for a week and I took all the precautions. Really need to strike a balance somehow. Also that's really cool with the mold study. I saw people using that analogy to model empty planes getting reforested in that show cooked. Somehow it seems to make sense that it would also be applicable to city growth"

" Butze, does that light whole wheat dough from the no kneading book work well for pizza?"
" Nice, we're about to try out the bread oven down in Madison"
" Missed the opportunity to take pics this time, but we're going to fire it up again tomorrow. The pizzas today came out amazing"
 <Media omitted>
 <Media omitted>
" Thanks for the invite, Jim! Yeah, I've been in Madison for the weekend."
 <Media omitted>
 Just saw this hilarious clip from a Netflix movie where Paul Rudd's trying to get a kid to try a slim Jim and he keeps saying 'come on! Nibble the Jim! Take a bite of the James!'
" Ah sheeeuuutt, you bouta catch Em all"
 <Media omitted>
 Hahaha
 You guys notice anything in the tree line of that picture of Butze with the Pokemon?
" Yep, there's also one in the mountains and in the bottom left corner"
 And there's a snorlax
 A little app called PowerPoint
" Yeah, that one gets me every time"
 Jim's expression is like 'what you talkin' bout'
 <Media omitted>
 Gifs don't work in WhatsApp? Dang.
 It's from Swiss army man when he uses his friends farts to cross the ocean
 <Media omitted>
 Hahaha
 Well at least there's always Pokemon
" Also, just want to share that I had the opportunity to shit in the woods twice this weekend during a two day backpacking trip with my dad and his coworkers. Amazing and recommendable experience. Very liberating. Butze, have you tried it yet? Also, we should do a section of the long trail some time soon. Can't believe I didn't try out backpacking earlier. So fun"
 Both and now also to calling it 'releasing the chocolate dragon' hahaha
 Holy shit that looks awesome!
" Not yet, was a little set back by the India trip, aiming for end of August to defend."
 Hahaha sure am
" So who's in for Hops in the Hills? It's August 6th and I'll be going up to VT on the 4th. Sean, I think you said you're traveling, but I figured I'd double check. Also, Jim, feel free to bring Aru if you're able to come. Dave, you should see the new brew equipment my dad's picked up. It's gettin serious haha"
" Happy birthday, Jim! My app stopped sending notifications again. Looks like I missed some great stuff on here."
 Hit a little obstacle. Nothing serious just time consuming. Should be done by the end of this month and defending by the middle of Sept
" Thanks, yeah it's open to the public and I definitely let you guys know when it's finally scheduled"
 I'm definitely still in for Labor Day
 Haha awesome. Why is 'Patriots' in quotes? Is the mascot meant to be ironic?
" Check out Montieth and the new dorm at UConn. They put up these video tours on YouTube. The guy moves kind of slow, so you have to fast forward https://youtu.be/kcff9HxcTIE"
 https://youtu.be/hvKtgQGSPzQ
 And McMahon is the best dining hall now. Total flip. And they're tearing down the grad dorms across from the coop. Doesn't look like they're doing anything with alumni
 Haha
" Yup, it'll be all good vibes and meat sweats"
 The brick oven is operational
 You guys feel like doing a little hike in the woods this weekend like last time?
" Nice, I'm going to see if I can find some new trail options to check out"
 Ahhh booyah
 Do you guys have any interest in kayaking? My parents and uncle pay are going either Saturday or Sunday and they said they'd reserve us kayaks too if we wanted to go.
 Awesome
 Aahhh sheeeeuuuuttt
 <Media omitted>
" Dang, was trying to record this barred owl that I keep hearing"
 Things doing its version of tinder
" Sean, are you carpooling with Rob/when are you heading up?"
 Ok cool
 Haha sweet
 How much meat do you have so far?
" Haha aahhh sheeeuuutt, I think I'm getting anticipatory meat sweats"
 Sounds good
" Thanks for coming up guys! Another successful, meat-filled extravaganza."
" Sean, I think you may have left your preserves. We can mail them to you. Just let me know your address"
" Dave, your phone shit the bucket too? The last message I sent on my last phone was in this chat and then it never turned on again. Just got a new phone today"
 Hahaha
 Hahaha perfect
 <Media omitted>
 On radio this morning
" Haha yeah, and when I switched the channel after the song was over, I shit you not, mungo Jerry was on. Banner day already"
 That does look good!
 Started following you. Some pretty headsy bread talk going down
 Hahaha
 <Media omitted>
 Haha love how quickly booyah references made their way into the convo
 And then I go to Facebook and am reminded of the other move we like to reference
 <Media omitted>
 It's a fuckin' Pomeranian. It's has fuckin papers. The dog has fuckin papers
 Hahaha
" Ahhh sheeeuuuutt, delivering a complete protein source in a delicious loaf. The game really done changed"
" Speaking of sports, I just found that someone posted all the episodes of Running Wild with Bear Grylls. The one with Marshawn Lynch aka Beast Mode is hilarious https://youtu.be/eMnKzsYvHAs"
 Gotta get him the ball tho
 There's a shaq episode too
 Hahaha awesome
 I'm not sure I can handle watching it. It's too embarrassing
" Haha 'hey Morty, this must be the timeline where everyone went fucking crazy'"
 Haha
" Trump makes no sense. Hillary at least looks like she has a plan, even though she is definitely pandering"
 Horrible
" Yeah, I was thinking along similar lines. Not very hopeful"
 Hahaha that would have been perfect
 Stick to the hits first haha
 'Kuh kuh kuh kuh khaattmmaaanndduuu' - my favorite lyric from that one
" You could always do Napalm Death's U Suffer. If you slip that in, she won't even be fully sure that a song was actually played"
 Trying to defend sometime next month. Had to slow down a little. I was getting too burned out. Slowly but surely I'm getting there.
 Most likely November
 http://patch.com/connecticut/mansfield/scary-clown-rumors-send-uconn-students-cemetery-streets-hockey-sticks-golf-clu
 Apparently UConn students are fixing to take matters in their own hands
 The second article made me laugh because they use the word fracas to describe the clown hunt on Monday
 I kind of feel bad for clowns.
 Ah fuckin' multiple
 Haha
 Ahhh boooyyyaahhhh
" Love the quote, 'my horse would LOVE this!' Haha, just saw the voice assist post too. Hilarious."
" I think the same thing is happening in South Boston where my sister lives. Especially near her condo there are a number of newly converted and new build condos. Just walking around the neighborhood, you'll see a lot of people who are our age with young kids who most likely work in the seaport. Kelly has said that she knows a number of people at her work who also live in south Boston. So it could be a bunch of 'Kellys' buying up condos in Somerville"
 I don't doubt it haha
 Hahaha 'add to my roth'
" It's painful, but I'm still watching"
 I just tapped out. Can't stand it anymore
" God, I really hope there's no violence because of that idiot"
 Dang that looks good
" Dave, I just saw that a teacher, Mrs. Hayes, from JFK High School in Waterbury, CT won national teacher of the year and got to meet Obama. Did you have her?"
 Looks like Waterbury's really becoming quite the place complete with a national teacher of the year and on top of that the timex museum and Jesus land. Woo
 Just had a math breakthrough. Bout to QED the f outta this dissertation
 Haha
" Both. As Gordon Bombay said, 'Where there's a will, there's a way.... quack, quack, Quack, Quack...'"
 What are you in pt for?
" Dang, I can imagine that would be painful"
 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DVf88LuHTPo
 <Media omitted>
 Haha you mean 'Garrett with two r's and two t's'
" Lol, Rick Ross and bread shaping, amazing. Saw the finished loaves on instagram. Lookin damn good"
 Did the guy have his own brewery in Canada? Or was he a beer master at one?
 Haha that comic gets me every time.
" Haha exactly. 'No hopes, no dreams, just waiting to die...'"
 I'm absolutely crushing my dissertation writing while listening to tycho right now. I'd never really listened to them before but I saw them recommended in my Apple Music and remembered you guys talking about them so I gave them a try. Really great stuff to work to.
" If I can meet two deadlines this week, I should finish before or on Dec 2"
 <Media omitted>
" Check out this comparison of computation time required for the model I developed versus the standard, finite element analysis, and a comparable simplified model called ECF. All three give roughly the same predictions."
" Pretty arcane stuff, but exciting after years of work"
 My reaction exactly when I first realized how fast my model was
" Yeah, Jim, you're going to like the network model I made. And 5-6 orders of magnitude is just the solution step. My method also doesn't require meshing, which can take hours. So in total it's literally about a billion times faster"
" Thanks, Dave! I think I owe you a happy belated birthday too!"
" Yeah, he was very cautious all the way."
" Agreed, I saw this report on rural healthcare last week and I really began to understand why there are so many people angry enough to vote for trump https://youtu.be/LzPCEgc7s_s"
" And if Trump tweets us into nuclear war, the ensuring nuclear winter will not only halt global warming but will also reduce the population problem. Always look on the bright side"
 We can all go to the Super Bowl!
 Hahaha
 I feel like we need to bubble wrap Ruth bader Ginsburg and assign a doctor to check on her daily. Same for the other old liberal leaning judges
 Those are some good points
 Did you guys happen to hear about that kid who got arrested for grabbing a girl's ass at UConn?
 They got surveillance footage of him running away after he did it and they sent out still frames of him to the entire campus. He was found and arrested in like an hour
" And then the next day, a guy guilty of the exact same thing became president"
 What an amazing time
" Good ol' billy red face was on Conan talking about the election and sports. Definitely some good stuff, there's three segments "
 Actually only two segments
" 'Trump is such a dope, he's actually gonna make me vote for a woman.' Haha offending both sides in one tweet"
 <Media omitted>
" I guess so, I chose picture and then it had another option to use GIPHY"
 <Media omitted>
 Game done changed
" Haha, it's amazing how there's no background music for a lot of mr. rogers segments. This one is just crackly silence and a man describing how to eat a cheese-wrapped banana. So peaceful"
 Hahaha
 <Media omitted>
 <Media omitted>
" Hahaha, gingerly grab the pizza and shove him back into the seat and then send the car back on its way"
 And that's the waaaayy the news goes
 <Media omitted>
 Hahaha
 Makes me think of that Chappell bit from his snl monologue about yelling Wu Tang! just before have sex.
 <Media omitted>
 Is that your place in Somerville? Living minimally definitely has its perks.
 https://youtu.be/y2I0JlwBaBs
" Made me think of that Chappell bit about if you could live in a cardboard box and still get laid, men would"
" Jeez, How many ovens does that guy have?"
 That actually sounds really convenient.
 Haha ahhh sheeuuutt
 So it's looking like my defense is going to be Dec 5 at 9:30 am. Boutta drop some knowledge
 <Media omitted>
 That's how I'm going to conclude the presentation
" Yup, assuming I don't really f up somehow in the next couple weeks, I'll finally be done"
 Hahaha oh god
 Thanks!
 Haha that one's great
 Damn that looks good! Saw on instagram you had some loaves with nuts or fruit too?
 Great distribution of the cranberries and walnuts. Paul Hollywood would be pleased
 I love how that guy's animations go from harmless and silly to super dark super fast and then back
" When we die there is nothing. Until then, there's French toast. Ooooeeee"
" Sure are, and naturally all of you guys and any significant others are invited"
 Jesus haha
 <Media omitted>
 It's in UTEB 476 in Storrs. Are you going to be in the Storrs area?
 It's at 930am
 I just done clowned on that defense. Ahh boooyyyaahhh
 Haha exactly
 Thanks!
 <Media omitted>
 Haha exactly
 Haha me too
 Hahaha
" Amazing haha, I'm just picturing some old lady walking by the tree like 'ooo that's nice, well what does this one say?'"
" Lol'ed pretty hard at this, Dave: 'Maybe you should leave James at home and let Jimmy go to the party.'"
" That's exactly what this breakfast place called Toast near UConn does. Great bread there and I thought that they must bake it themselves, but it turns out they order it frozen like that and just cook it the last bit of the way."
" Speaking of hamster wheels, I had an interview on Wednesday at the Army Research Lab. I'm actually pretty excited about potentially working there. The funny thing was that the head of the branch that I was interviewing at is named Cindy. And people kept saying things like, 'oh we'll just run that by Cindy'. And all I could think of was Cindy Burns from Jim's 15 min avant garde vox recording."
" I'd be a civilian contractor in a group working on basic science for fuel cells and batteries. It turns out that efficient energy technologies are good for combat because they're silent and can potentially be easier to transport. So even climate-change-denying Trump will effectively be funding research to fight climate change by funding the department of defense. That said, other groups at the lab work on some pretty deadly sheeuuutt."
 Haha silent but deadly
 don't you remember family dinners on Sundays in Prudence? Haha
 Haha
 Hahaha
 Looks like I got the job at the army research lab. I'll be moving down to D.C. sometime in February I think.
 Very excitement
" Thanks! Yeah, it's a post doc."
 Thanks!
 Hahaha
