8/27/15, 7:03 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha
8/27/15, 7:03 PM ~ Sean B~ Amazing
8/27/15, 7:04 PM ~ Alex C~ Paid 99 cents to upgrade my caption app to get white lettering. Totally worth it
8/27/15, 7:05 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah that pretty much paid for itself
8/27/15, 7:28 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Loool
8/27/15, 7:28 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Money well spent
8/27/15, 7:56 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Haha this is awesome

8/29/15, 6:44 PM ~ Alex C~ I love that band's name. Perfectly chosen
8/29/15, 6:46 PM ~ Alex C~ <Media omitted>
8/29/15, 6:47 PM ~ Sean B~ Best hashtag
8/29/15, 6:47 PM ~ Alex C~ The girly cursive really makes it haha
8/29/15, 7:45 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Haha nice
8/30/15, 12:34 PM ~ Dave Wu~ So many commercials on tv for website building and marketing services. But the real question is can their CEO freestyle in a Scottish accent?
8/30/15, 12:42 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha
8/30/15, 12:42 PM ~ Sean B~ They sure can't
8/30/15, 12:54 PM ~ Dave Wu~ That'll be the deal breaker question in rfp's for web designers. 'Oh you can't spit bars over this beat...gtfo.'
8/31/15, 10:28 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Spent what seemed like hours going through sas files and taking notes..... Then I woke up. Worst type of dream.
8/31/15, 11:17 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Life is bullshit man
8/31/15, 11:19 AM ~ Sean B~ https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ogXONbN_2To
8/31/15, 12:39 PM ~ Dave Wu~ And then the case I helped carefully assemble...A group of auditors just ran a three p train on it.
8/31/15, 3:12 PM ~ Sean B~ Gettin three-p'ed any god damn way
8/31/15, 3:31 PM ~ Sean B~ But did they flip the dick down?
8/31/15, 3:51 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Their team was methodical. Though they gave weak responses to some counters, they were in the position of power and they def flipped the dick down. Wouldn't have been surprise if I heard a bunch of hype men in the background of the conference call.
8/31/15, 3:53 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Made me remember... In life you're either getting fucked in the ass or fucking people in the ass. Choose a position..... I might make my next job with the government regulators
8/31/15, 4:04 PM ~ james e mooradian~ 3Ps are seriously the way to go if you want a cushy ass job. Basically the authority/benefit of a government job with the pay of a private consultant
8/31/15, 4:05 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Sometimes you have to work hard, but when you do, it's usually to shut down the studio
8/31/15, 4:17 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Yeah rolling up in places and screaming 'prepare to be fucked by the long dick of the law.' I need to get in on this consultant/regulatory train.
8/31/15, 8:18 PM ~ Alex C~ Hahaha heavy booyah referencing today, awesome
9/1/15, 11:06 AM ~ Dave Wu~ So for labor day what foods should we bring? I still got that turkey in deep freeze and can always murk Meatman for more variety.
9/1/15, 11:06 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Sea dogs anyone?
9/1/15, 11:10 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Better get a keg of that raspberry beer to add to the bar
9/1/15, 11:17 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Pretty sure showing up with a keg of sea dog would earn me a permanent ban from Alex's place. Though it would beg the question who would ever drink that much sea dog to warrant retailing of bulk quantities.
9/1/15, 11:19 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Wait. Probably the girls impressed with my purchase of the sampler.
9/1/15, 11:30 AM ~ Sean B~ Haha I remember that
9/1/15, 11:58 AM ~ Alex C~ Haha I just talked with my mom and she said she can get stuff to grill for dinner and she has a ton of eggs from the neighbors. Other than that if you guys wanted to bring stuff for lunch like cold cuts, bread, etc. and other stuff to go with eggs for breakfast like bagels and whatnot, that would be cool. Also some snacks and and a water bottle or two for hiking could be good.
9/1/15, 12:21 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Yeah a hiking snack besides almonds would be good. Would the turkey be doable?
9/1/15, 12:25 PM ~ Alex C~ If you're going to bring it, you should probably start thawing it in the fridge. It'd be doable if thawed
9/1/15, 12:28 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Yep I'll start that tonight. Or me and Jim can do fast faucet thingamajig defrost like our previous turkey cooking adventures.
9/1/15, 12:37 PM ~ Alex C~ Haha probably better to just start thawing tonight, faucet defrost was less than optimal
9/1/15, 12:45 PM ~ Sean B~ I'll get some fancy Italian cold cuts.  Get some prosciutto up in this bitch
9/1/15, 1:10 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Sopressata is the way to go dude. Trust
9/1/15, 1:12 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Also do we have methods for cooking turkey?
9/1/15, 1:26 PM ~ Alex C~ Yeah, I just asked my mom if it would be possible and she said definitely
9/1/15, 1:29 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Aw sheeeit... We're gonna get so weird.
9/1/15, 1:33 PM ~ Alex C~ <Media omitted>
9/1/15, 1:40 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha
9/1/15, 1:40 PM ~ Sean B~ Gonna go 'ape shit'
9/1/15, 1:43 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Better start looking up good ways to cook this bad boy
9/1/15, 1:43 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I'm thinking combo overnight brine and butter/herbs under the skin
9/1/15, 1:44 PM ~ Sean B~ Awww Jim you nasty
9/1/15, 1:48 PM ~ Dave Wu~ That picture lol. Had to mute the phone to laugh during a doctor call.
9/1/15, 2:06 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Hey Dave do you think the turkey is still good to eat? Not sure what a year of freezer storage does to meats
9/1/15, 2:07 PM ~ Alex C~ <Media omitted>
9/1/15, 2:07 PM ~ Alex C~ Google says it should be ok
9/1/15, 2:07 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lol it might be on the cusp
9/1/15, 2:07 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Should be I've checked and its did for 9 months to a year
9/1/15, 2:08 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Hey we could always pull a bear grylls on a hike
9/1/15, 2:08 PM ~ Alex C~ Oh Jesus haha
9/1/15, 2:08 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol just lie back and think of England
9/1/15, 2:08 PM ~ Alex C~ 'So sorry... Oh argh uh... So sorry'
9/1/15, 2:09 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lmao
9/1/15, 2:09 PM ~ Sean B~ Well I've had food poisoning 3 times now so I'm practically an expert.  I'll help us all through it if that should befall is
9/1/15, 2:09 PM ~ Sean B~ us*
9/1/15, 2:09 PM ~ Alex C~ <Media omitted>
9/1/15, 2:10 PM ~ Alex C~ Felt like it was again germane to the convo
9/1/15, 2:12 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I'll bring some backup meat just in case the turkey turns into Shaq attacks on the backboard.
9/1/15, 2:14 PM ~ Alex C~ When exactly did you get that turkey?
9/1/15, 2:22 PM ~ Dave Wu~ November....
9/1/15, 2:23 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Was it fresh when you got it or was it frozen?
9/1/15, 2:23 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Frozen always
9/1/15, 2:24 PM ~ Alex C~ We should be ok then
9/1/15, 2:24 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I mean the turkey may have been frozen for a while before then right?
9/1/15, 2:25 PM ~ james e mooradian~ How long does frozen food hang around at costco
9/1/15, 2:26 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Eh its probably fine
9/1/15, 2:26 PM ~ james e mooradian~ 10-11 months frozen
9/1/15, 2:29 PM ~ Sean B~ According to the interwebs the one year limit is for quality of taste, not safety.
9/1/15, 2:30 PM ~ Sean B~ So we shouldn't have to worry about vommitting out of our assholes, hopefully
9/1/15, 3:02 PM ~ Dave Wu~ These were from the Thanksgiving season. They were a special batch for employees.
9/1/15, 5:09 PM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
9/1/15, 5:09 PM ~ Sean B~ Is that cloudy J having her period? Haha
9/1/15, 5:12 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Rejected cartoons by Don Hertzfeldt
9/1/15, 5:14 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Watch 'Rejected - Don Hertzfeldt' on YouTube - https://youtu.be/9l7sxPLhOQk
9/1/15, 5:33 PM ~ Sean B~ Ooh yeah I remember that haha
9/1/15, 6:02 PM ~ james e mooradian~ So I'm running a program called analyst at work. I was looking over old run logs and couldn't help but laugh
9/1/15, 6:02 PM ~ james e mooradian~ <Media omitted>
9/1/15, 6:03 PM ~ Sean B~ IT is gonna seize your hard drive lol
9/1/15, 6:04 PM ~ james e mooradian~ All these prn files on the network drive
9/1/15, 6:05 PM ~ Sean B~ Fappin on the job again
9/1/15, 6:07 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Damn that's a lot of anal prn
9/1/15, 7:06 PM ~ Alex C~ <Media omitted>
9/1/15, 7:06 PM ~ Alex C~ <Media omitted>
9/1/15, 7:24 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol
9/1/15, 8:05 PM ~ Alex C~ Here's the trail guide for hiking Killington, could be good http://www.killington.com/site/mountain/trail_map/hiking/S15_TrailMap_Hike_web.pdf
9/1/15, 8:06 PM ~ Alex C~ There's also the healdville trail that goes up Okemo
9/1/15, 8:06 PM ~ Alex C~ http://www.vtstateparks.com/pdfs/okemo_sf_trails.pdf
9/1/15, 8:08 PM ~ Alex C~ Here's some other ones near okemo
https://www.yourplaceinvermont.com/things-to-do-vermont/summer-sports-recreation/south-central-vermont-hiking-walking-guide/
9/1/15, 8:09 PM ~ Alex C~ Haha just noticed that in the last link, the hike that we did last time is listed as 'aggressive'
9/1/15, 8:12 PM ~ Alex C~ This one goes by some sweet cliffs, about 2.5h round trip 
http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_MEDIA/stelprdb5315077.pdf
9/1/15, 8:14 PM ~ Alex C~ About a half hour drive from ludlow
9/1/15, 8:23 PM ~ Dave Wu~ 2.5 hour round trip sounds good. Not 3 hours one way.
9/1/15, 8:24 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha nice
9/1/15, 8:25 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah 2.5 hours is solid
9/1/15, 8:27 PM ~ Alex C~ Haha yeah, full disclosure, it does involve doing over 1000 vertical ft. I figure though that if it gets strenuous, it won't be like we're in a rush, so we could take our time, have snacks and rests and stuff
9/1/15, 8:27 PM ~ Sean B~ 1000 ft is nothing
9/1/15, 8:28 PM ~ Sean B~ The hikes I did out west were about 2500ft, 3-4 hrs
9/1/15, 8:29 PM ~ Alex C~ Yeah we're gonna clown all over this trail
9/1/15, 8:42 PM ~ Dave Wu~ This will be nice for my hiking resume.
9/1/15, 9:10 PM ~ Sean B~ We'll take some photos so you can pimp out your Okc profile
9/1/15, 9:12 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Sorry xzibit, but i already shut down the okc profile.
9/2/15, 2:07 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Nothing like having a meeting with the operations manager and he opens with 'We got a big piece of shit and it's about to hit but the fan, and there's gonna be shit everywhere.'
9/2/15, 2:19 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha
9/2/15, 2:30 PM ~ Dave Wu~ It was funny until we reviewed all the current anal prolapsing issues plaguing our office.
9/2/15, 9:33 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
9/3/15, 10:46 AM ~ Dave Wu~ How are we all getting up to Vermont? Any carpooling or pick ups from the bus station?
9/3/15, 10:48 AM ~ Sean B~ I'm bringing Rob.  Planning to drive up in his car
9/3/15, 10:49 AM ~ Alex C~ I'm planning on heading up in the early afternoon around 2 or 3 from Storrs
9/3/15, 11:03 AM ~ Dave Wu~ I have work until 6 tomorrow. Might lug the turkey to work and and stash it in the fridge.
9/3/15, 11:04 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Then make a straight shot up 91 for an ETA of 2100
9/3/15, 11:04 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Jim dunno if you wanna carpool?
9/3/15, 11:17 AM ~ james e mooradian~ I can carpool. I'll probably have to work until between 6 and 7 tmmr
9/3/15, 11:17 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Depending on where you work tmmr we can either carpool from new Haven or meet somewhere on the way
9/3/15, 11:28 AM ~ Dave Wu~ I'll be in Wallingford so a quick hop on 15
9/3/15, 11:29 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Works for me
9/3/15, 12:30 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I'll drive down to New Haven. Should get there just about the same time you get out of work.
9/3/15, 12:35 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Nice dude. Gonna get so schwifty this weekend.
9/3/15, 12:37 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Gotta shit on the floor
9/3/15, 1:08 PM ~ Sean B~ lol what
9/3/15, 1:10 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Rick and Morty, dude. Watch it. It'll change your life.
9/3/15, 1:14 PM ~ Sean B~ Oh yeah been meaning to watch that
9/3/15, 5:18 PM ~ Alex C~ Just thought of another thing for VT. If you guys could bring sleeping bags and pillows, that would help minimize the number of sheets to wash at the end of the weekend.
9/3/15, 5:19 PM ~ Sean B~ Ok
9/3/15, 7:23 PM ~ Dave Wu~ So on top of the turkey I'm bringing some back ribs. Anyone gonna handle the vegetable department. Really want nothing but net all weekend.
9/3/15, 7:24 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Do you want me to handle some of the meat department? I can go to the elm city market and get some fresh to death butchered cuts tomorrow afternoon
9/3/15, 7:25 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Figured a whole family sized turkey would be a ton of food tho
9/3/15, 7:26 PM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
9/3/15, 7:27 PM ~ Sean B~ Aw nice
9/3/15, 7:27 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I can always get some cuts, just keep it in mind
9/3/15, 7:27 PM ~ james e mooradian~ T boner steak?
9/3/15, 7:28 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Yeah I'd be down for some boners too.
9/3/15, 7:36 PM ~ Sean B~ Yes please
9/3/15, 7:36 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I'll see what they got
9/3/15, 7:36 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Porterhouse is a tough cut to cook but it's fucking tasty
9/3/15, 8:03 PM ~ Sean B~ That'd be sweet
9/3/15, 8:35 PM ~ Alex C~ You sure that won't be too much? We're only there for two dinners. My mom already made meatballs, sausage and peppers and she picked up steak tips. She'll likely have a batch of chili too she said.
9/3/15, 9:13 PM ~ Sean B~ Sounds like we're gonna achieve a Kenny Powers level of awesomeness
9/3/15, 9:13 PM ~ Sean B~ https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mZE9fJ-ER0M
9/3/15, 10:20 PM ~ Dave Wu~ And bring your homebrew empties
9/3/15, 10:36 PM ~ Sean B~ I recycled mine 😕
9/3/15, 10:36 PM ~ Sean B~ Didn't realize we were supposed to keep them
9/4/15, 9:27 AM ~ Alex C~ I still got mine. I'll bring them up
9/4/15, 10:33 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Butze, this is why we can't have nice things... Jk, I'll just pick up extra bottles for the next bottle session.
9/4/15, 10:58 AM ~ Sean B~ Sry dude
9/4/15, 3:02 PM ~ james e mooradian~ <Media omitted>
9/4/15, 3:16 PM ~ Sean B~ Nice
9/4/15, 4:33 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Looks like the end of this weekend will be like trying to duck a beach ball through a basketball hoop.
9/4/15, 4:33 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Dunk*
9/4/15, 4:48 PM ~ Sean B~ Better bring the snake
9/4/15, 6:21 PM ~ Sean B~ If anyone is still gonna be stopping at a store, I need fresh basil.  They're all out at whole foods.  If not no big deal
9/4/15, 6:22 PM ~ Sean B~ Nvm I found it
9/4/15, 6:25 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Do I need to pick anything up? Feels kinda weird bring more or less empty handed
9/4/15, 6:26 PM ~ Alex C~ Tons of stuff here
9/4/15, 6:26 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I can pick up more vegetables than the lone pepper I had in the picture
9/4/15, 6:38 PM ~ Alex C~ No worries, we're pretty stocked up here. Could always bring some beer. Found out that the taps have been shut down while my dad's away. We still have a good amount of beer though here
9/4/15, 6:41 PM ~ Sean B~ Noooo :(
9/4/15, 6:45 PM ~ Alex C~ Yeah, apparently he was having some problems with one of the controllers and didn't have time to get it all straightened out
9/4/15, 6:46 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Oh damn 😨
9/4/15, 6:46 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Okay I can pick up some beet
9/4/15, 6:46 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Beer
9/4/15, 7:33 PM ~ Sean B~ We just left, should get there at 1030-11
9/4/15, 7:56 PM ~ Alex C~ Sounds good
9/4/15, 8:13 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Dave and I are on our way top
9/4/15, 8:13 PM ~ james e mooradian~ We'll probably get there a little after 11
9/4/15, 8:44 PM ~ Sean B~ Alex what's the address?
9/4/15, 8:48 PM ~ Alex C~ 1090 Town Farm Rd., Ludlow, VT
9/4/15, 9:08 PM ~ Sean B~ Thanks

9/7/15, 7:05 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha
9/8/15, 3:29 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Just found out my company fucked up. My health insurance doesn't kick in until next week, so I've been without coverage for a while now. Really killing it in Roy II.
9/8/15, 3:41 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Don't pull any off-white Persian rugs from the top shelf dude.
9/8/15, 4:11 PM ~ Sean B~ He's taking Roy off the grid!  No health insurance!
9/9/15, 12:28 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Sigh.... The customer service reps have been really fucking up. Now I notice one of them uses comic sans with multicolor font for an email signature..... Not sure of I can take them seriously
9/9/15, 3:48 PM ~ james e mooradian~ <Media omitted>
9/9/15, 4:27 PM ~ Sean B~ Nice
9/9/15, 4:28 PM ~ Alex C~ <Media omitted>
9/9/15, 5:25 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha wow that is some dedication
9/9/15, 5:32 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Yeah that guy is braving the heat and the stares.
9/9/15, 5:42 PM ~ Sean B~ Guy is just going off the grid
9/9/15, 5:42 PM ~ Sean B~ All or nothing
9/9/15, 7:29 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Guess that guy without the helmet has the best armor after all
9/10/15, 10:51 AM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
9/10/15, 11:51 AM ~ Sean B~ Nice
9/10/15, 11:52 AM ~ Sean B~ Took me a while to notice the window in the last frame.  Really ties it together
9/10/15, 11:53 AM ~ Dave Wu~ That along with the family portrait and little dilapidated home details
9/11/15, 12:14 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Email for credit limit increase and then one from my 401k plan saying I have good diversification. Is this supposed to be the RL equivalent of the video game achievement pop ups. Because they feel equally empty.
9/11/15, 1:28 PM ~ Alex C~ Those things would be in the Wu Simulator game summary
9/11/15, 1:29 PM ~ Alex C~ <Media omitted>
9/11/15, 1:29 PM ~ Alex C~ <Media omitted>
9/11/15, 1:29 PM ~ Alex C~ Picture of a friend of mine at Burning man. His pose made me think of the human evolution picture. Love that he's clutching Doritos
9/11/15, 1:37 PM ~ Sean B~ Awesome
9/11/15, 5:48 PM ~ Sean B~ Someone posted this on Facebook the other day.  Just take a moment to appreciate this epitome of shitty 90s nu metal.  Everything about it is a stereotype of the genre.  Like a poor mans linkin park.
9/11/15, 5:48 PM ~ Sean B~ https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lYBIRHi5-o8
9/11/15, 5:50 PM ~ Dave Wu~ The video icon already says a lot. White dude with bleach blonde hair.... This will be interesting.
9/11/15, 5:51 PM ~ Sean B~ The guitar tone is especially horrendous.  Not even sure how they managed to achieve such a sound
9/11/15, 6:01 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Valnøtt pedal
9/13/15, 2:22 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Got some long stubble going... If I keep this to the end of the week I'll have a basic beard.
9/13/15, 2:23 PM ~ Dave Wu~ To shave or not to shave...
9/13/15, 3:36 PM ~ Sean B~ Grow it!
9/13/15, 4:55 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
9/13/15, 4:55 PM ~ Sean B~ This could be you
9/13/15, 4:59 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Lmao, that's a gnarly beard though.
9/13/15, 5:15 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah dude that's what you gotta shoot for
9/13/15, 5:16 PM ~ Sean B~ You'll be knee deep in the klunge
9/13/15, 7:22 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
9/13/15, 7:22 PM ~ Sean B~ Another brilliant R&M moment
9/13/15, 8:02 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Lol yeah, so deep.
9/13/15, 8:05 PM ~ Alex C~ Haha just watched that episode yesterday. I've watched all of them now. Can't wait for the new episode tonight
9/13/15, 8:06 PM ~ Sean B~ I gotta catch up
9/13/15, 8:09 PM ~ Alex C~ Also nice use of 'klunge' earlier haha Totally forgot about that word

9/13/15, 8:24 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha
9/13/15, 8:26 PM ~ Dave Wu~ And yeah klunge. That British vernacular.
9/14/15, 11:16 AM ~ Sean B~ Remember that article one of yall posted a while back about when and when not to 'give a fuck' and learning to ration out your fuck-giving? Where was that from? Anyone still have the link?
9/14/15, 1:33 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Lol I don't remember that article, but it sounds interesting
9/14/15, 1:34 PM ~ Dave Wu~ And I scrolled past pencil mustache pizza man, I could hear the words 'it'sa tight butthole'
9/14/15, 1:35 PM ~ Dave Wu~ As i*
9/14/15, 1:38 PM ~ Alex C~ Here's the article: http://markmanson.net/not-giving-a-fuck
9/14/15, 1:56 PM ~ Sean B~ YES
9/14/15, 1:56 PM ~ Sean B~ thank you
9/14/15, 2:34 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Speaking of not giving a fuck, I've decided to go full retard with growing a beard.
9/14/15, 2:34 PM ~ james e mooradian~ 👍
9/14/15, 2:39 PM ~ Sean B~ Hell yeah
9/14/15, 2:39 PM ~ Sean B~ You won't regret it
9/14/15, 2:41 PM ~ james e mooradian~ http://giphy.com/gifs/104ueR8J1OPM2s
9/14/15, 2:42 PM ~ Alex C~ Hahaha
9/14/15, 2:56 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Haha wtf
9/14/15, 3:01 PM ~ james e mooradian~ He's saying 'do it' if you weren't able to tell
9/14/15, 3:01 PM ~ james e mooradian~ That YouTube video was great gif fodder
9/14/15, 3:02 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Ah. Was about to say being cool like shia labeouf is not making a good case for having a beard.
9/14/15, 3:03 PM ~ james e mooradian~ That's one of the more tame gifs of him saying 'do it'
9/14/15, 5:05 PM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
9/14/15, 5:05 PM ~ Sean B~ Awesome
9/14/15, 7:07 PM ~ Sean B~ So here's a little anecdote I think yall will appreciate.  I recently found out via Facebook that a kid I used to go to prep school with went to divinity school and recently became ordained as a deacon in the episcopal church.  I recalled a particular conversation I had with him in 7th grade about our mutual interest in pornography.  He confided in me that he especially enjoyed videos of anal porn because he 'loves the sound the girl makes when it goes in'.  Yeah.  Now the dude is serving people communion on Sundays.
9/14/15, 7:18 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Jesus
9/14/15, 7:29 PM ~ Sean B~ Yup
9/14/15, 7:44 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I'm not sure what's worse: the fact that he's ordained clergy now or the discussion you two had as seventh graders.
9/14/15, 7:45 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol.  It actually might have been 8th grade.  Not that that really makes it any better
9/14/15, 7:45 PM ~ Dave Wu~ The sound of butt stuff is also stuck in my head.
9/14/15, 7:45 PM ~ Sean B~ But yeah even I was a bit taken aback at the time
9/14/15, 7:45 PM ~ Sean B~ Being all of 14 years old
9/14/15, 7:47 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Those were the early days of the internet, too. Don't think any streaming sites existed yet. Or if they did it was pixel porn. He'd have that stuff on hard copy DVD/vhs.
9/14/15, 7:48 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah.  Or limewire
9/14/15, 7:50 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Yeah way before HD, way before 16:9 standard. Those clicky clack days of porn.
9/14/15, 7:51 PM ~ Sean B~ 'Back in my day we had to work for our porn!'
9/14/15, 8:51 PM ~ Alex C~ <Media omitted>
9/14/15, 8:53 PM ~ Alex C~ Wu had a good idea with that caption and it turned out to be relevant to the convo
9/14/15, 8:53 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol nice
9/15/15, 8:51 AM ~ Dave Wu~ http://www.vice.com/read/undergrads-today-are-the-worst-a-tas-confession?utm_source=vicefbus
9/15/15, 8:54 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Parts if this article made me think of your TA stories and the sordid state of higher ed.
9/15/15, 12:56 PM ~ Sean B~ Yep
9/15/15, 1:11 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Just imagining you guys on your knees with arms to the heavens bellowing out 'How do I reach these kids?'
9/15/15, 1:12 PM ~ Sean B~ Glad I'm not a TA anymore
9/15/15, 1:12 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Or Alex proctoring an exam and answer questions with a simple 'fuck should I know'
9/15/15, 1:54 PM ~ Alex C~ Haha doing a lab class this semester. Noob city
9/15/15, 2:52 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Machine shop again?
9/15/15, 2:54 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Or I mean the laser metal lab
9/15/15, 3:06 PM ~ Alex C~ No, not the machine shop again, thank god. 'Sensors Lab', it's a ton of horseshit

9/15/15, 9:20 PM ~ Alex C~ Can't think of a good pun name for it yet
9/15/15, 9:23 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha these are great
9/15/15, 9:23 PM ~ Sean B~ You should make a tumblr of these
9/15/15, 9:47 PM ~ Dave Wu~ This is awesome.
9/15/15, 9:47 PM ~ Alex C~ Think I'm gonna go with 'Simmeown de Beaupaws' for the second set
9/16/15, 12:34 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Damn, I had conversation with my mom about my time at UConn. And I remembered how much I fucking hated that place. Like coming out of North garage in the morning and feeling like I stepped in a streaming pile of shit. Or crossing streets with no fucks given while staring down bro drivers and occasionally whispering 'do it ya mother fucker.'

I'm glad I met y'all.  We really distilled our group down to something great.
9/16/15, 8:10 AM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
9/16/15, 8:13 AM ~ Sean B~ I'm LOLing just imagining you standing in a crosswalk saying 'do it motherfucker'
9/16/15, 9:02 AM ~ Dave Wu~ That's also why I find it particularly funny when Rick throws out the taunt in near death situations.
9/16/15, 11:05 AM ~ Alex C~ I also got a kick out of the 'do it motherfucker' line, super dark humor haha. I have to agree with your overall sentiment, Wu. We're really #blessed
9/16/15, 11:05 AM ~ Alex C~ <Media omitted>
9/16/15, 11:12 AM ~ Sean B~ #friendsforever
9/16/15, 11:12 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Lol you guys
9/16/15, 11:13 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Seriously though, i def side with Dave on this one. It took me until I was done with UConn for good to realize just how much I disliked that place
9/16/15, 11:14 AM ~ james e mooradian~ .. But you know, I'm sure the degree is worth the work
9/16/15, 11:15 AM ~ james e mooradian~ #finishstrongalex
9/16/15, 11:16 AM ~ Sean B~ Students Today, Niggas For Life
9/16/15, 11:23 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Lol.
9/16/15, 11:29 AM ~ james e mooradian~ <Media omitted>
9/16/15, 11:29 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Fuck yeah
9/16/15, 11:39 AM ~ Dave Wu~ People always repeat the 'college is the best time of your life' or 'I'd doing anything to relive college' mantras. I say bull shit.  I'm much happier in the workforce. Sure, I met great people and had some important life lessons. But overall college is a really disturbing 4 (7 in my case) year carnival/microcosm that I don't need to experience again. Had my fill.
9/16/15, 11:42 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Now I'm thinking... if I'm ever a parent how'd I justify sending a barely mature adult to such a place and paying 30-60k per year.
9/16/15, 11:52 AM ~ Sean B~ Yeah I think everyone has a different 'best time' of their life.  For some unfortunate people it was high school... Wouldn't want to be one of them.
9/16/15, 11:53 AM ~ Sean B~ The goal should be to 'peak' as late as possible.  Or never.  Just keep getting more awesome
9/16/15, 11:54 AM ~ Dave Wu~ When I'm 90, I'm gonna be going 90
9/16/15, 11:55 AM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha amen
9/16/15, 11:58 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Never go back to the carpet store
9/16/15, 12:00 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Jim, I feel like that could make a good motivational poster.
9/16/15, 5:21 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Chipotle in Hamden. All the patrons are prissy white girls and soccer mom's with kids rolling with luxury cars. Then the workers all come in city bus and look haggardly.... Tale off two cities.
9/17/15, 7:45 AM ~ Sean B~ Does anyone still have that long comic from last year with Mickey, Goofy, and Donald Duck.  Feel like a second dose of that is needed after yesterday's musings
9/17/15, 10:31 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Get ready to be bummed out

http://www.sassquach.com/journal/2013/11/4/boys-night.html
9/17/15, 10:36 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Also, I wish there was a one of the phone 'helpers' like siri or cortana but with the Mr. Meeseeks voice.
9/17/15, 11:17 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Oh man yeah that comic. So good but yeah pretty gloomy
9/17/15, 2:22 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah most of it is kind of gloomy but the end really ties it together on a brighter note.
9/17/15, 2:22 PM ~ Sean B~ When Micky realizes he is #blessed to have his buddies
9/17/15, 4:51 PM ~ Sean B~ 'It's just crazy cause I was just thinking, I don't have any friends who I've known my whole life. You guys all watched each other the whole way...you've all come so far. You're all doing new and exciting stuff and leading these crazy lives and you've still got so much to do. I wish I had a friend like that. Who was with me for like, the whole journey.'
9/17/15, 4:51 PM ~ Sean B~ Fuckin gets me right in the feels every time
9/17/15, 4:51 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
9/17/15, 9:17 PM ~ Alex C~ Just realized that that comic is multiple pages! I'll have to check out the rest. Seems pretty heavy tho. Reminds me of that time Mike Mitchell watched the movie Click by Sandler et al. and was moved to subsequently tell everyone that he appreciated them. I think he even called his mom.
9/17/15, 9:21 PM ~ Sean B~ LOL wow
9/17/15, 9:21 PM ~ Sean B~ But yeah you gotta read the whole thing.  It's a masterpiece
9/17/15, 9:24 PM ~ Alex C~ Changing subjects, I just gotta vent real quick about some TA bullshit. Yesterday, the professor that I TA for tried unknowingly (because her math is weak sauce) to assign me a grading load the violated my contract hours. I made an excel sheet and did basic hours accounting to prove to her that she had indeed violated it. Totally QED'd her. But now she's acting like she can still negotiate with me. I'm supposed to show my calculations to the other TAs tomorrow to make sure they agree, which as I see it doesn't matter. If they don't, I'm gonna straight go to the department head and if that doesn't work to the union if I have to. I don't get what the fuck she don't understand about contracts. Fucking academics sometimes, man... Sheeeuuuttt
9/17/15, 9:40 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lol I did not get the impression that click was that kind of movie
9/17/15, 9:41 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Also that is some bullshit
9/17/15, 9:41 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Seems common as fuck but its still not fair
9/17/15, 9:43 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I think UConn is one of those schools where the professors are hired with the idea that they devote 95% of their time to research
9/17/15, 9:43 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol damn dude. Props for fighting back tho
9/17/15, 9:43 PM ~ Sean B~ Just gotta stonewall her.  What's yours is yours
9/17/15, 9:43 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Hahaha
9/17/15, 9:43 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I agree with sean
9/17/15, 9:43 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Gotta keep it real
9/17/15, 9:44 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Show them what happens when you find a stranger in the alps
9/17/15, 9:44 PM ~ Sean B~ Is Alex Cocco gonna have to choke a bitch?
9/17/15, 9:46 PM ~ Alex C~ That exactly what I'm doing. Haha I'm not budging an inch. Told her today that as she has it now, either she is violating my contract or the students' papers that I grade get roughly half (turns out that the actual fraction cus I did the fuckin math) the attention that those of their peers get. Up to her
9/17/15, 10:46 PM ~ Sean B~ QED Bitch
9/18/15, 8:20 AM ~ Sean B~ Does your department ever use undergad graders? We do it all the time at tufts to reduce the load on the grad TAs.  And the labor is cheaper
9/18/15, 9:50 AM ~ james e mooradian~ I know that's happened in the past with the CE department. I'm not sure how common it is with other departments though
9/18/15, 10:25 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Ah, classic delegating... Keeps the world a turning.
9/18/15, 10:27 AM ~ Dave Wu~ On a side note, my mom told me I really needed to shave this morning. Asked me how I'm supposed to find a girl while rocking facial scruff.....
9/18/15, 10:28 AM ~ Sean B~ 'Mom that's what the bitches like these days'
9/18/15, 10:31 AM ~ Dave Wu~ For some reason I'm hearing that delivered in the tone and voice of the apple jacks kids.
9/18/15, 10:32 AM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha
9/18/15, 10:32 AM ~ Sean B~ We eat what we like
9/18/15, 10:38 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Hahaha fits well
9/18/15, 11:00 AM ~ Sean B~ Speaking of beards... I was out on a date last night at a bar.  Some random guy walks up to me and says 'I'm sorry man but I just have to do this real quick' and starts stroking my beard for a couple seconds, then walks away.  Few minutes later his friend comes up and explains that he bet the other guy that he wouldn't try to touch my beard.  I chuckled heartily.  He bought me a beer because he lost the bet.
9/18/15, 11:00 AM ~ Sean B~ Really getting some serious ROI out of this thing
9/18/15, 1:29 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Can't wait for the returns on the beard I'm growing. Especially since I'll be Asian with a beard. That's like a Articuno status.
9/18/15, 1:30 PM ~ Sean B~ LOL nice Pokemon reference

9/18/15, 10:40 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Jesus
9/18/15, 10:41 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Feel like I need to add something to lighten up after that article
9/18/15, 10:42 PM ~ james e mooradian~ <Media omitted>
9/18/15, 10:42 PM ~ james e mooradian~ That's the best I can do
9/18/15, 10:43 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha yeah sorry bout that
9/19/15, 9:50 AM ~ Dave Wu~ I've looked at this photo five times and I laugh uncontrollably each time. Bathroom humor just never gets old.
9/19/15, 11:44 AM ~ Alex C~ Haha that photo is great
9/19/15, 11:54 AM ~ Dave Wu~ It looks like Pooh has fallen on some hard times... Waking up face down in a sewage drain. Must've happened when Christopher Robin got older and interests changed to 'wanking.'
9/19/15, 11:55 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Like a depressing version of Toy Story.
9/19/15, 12:27 PM ~ james e mooradian~ So.. Toy story 3?
9/19/15, 12:58 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Oh right...forgot about that one and it's depressing plot.
9/19/15, 12:59 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Its*
9/19/15, 7:14 PM ~ Sean B~ And that's the waaaaAAaay the news goes
9/20/15, 11:01 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Number one most hated phrase in textbooks: 'we leave this as an exercise for the reader'
9/20/15, 11:05 AM ~ james e mooradian~ It's like, damn, the phrase is 'knowledge is built upon the shoulders of giants' not 'knowledge is built upon the shoulders of giants, but they're kinda dickish and make you climb up them instead of just picking you up and putting you on their shoulders. They're GIANTS, man, picking you up is like lifting a couple of grapes for them'
9/20/15, 11:22 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Lmao
9/20/15, 5:18 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol
9/20/15, 5:19 PM ~ Sean B~ One of my friends at tufts tried to use that exact line as part of his write up of a problem for a homework assignment.  The TA was not impressed.
9/21/15, 9:10 AM ~ Alex C~ The Large Hadron Collider is gearing up for its next experiments, 'Run 2.' As a promotional thing, CERN is doing a series of videos where 'experimental physics meets experimental music.' They recently released this video with Deerhoof: http://youtu.be/tZqQGbSnSTA

Nerdgasm
9/21/15, 9:24 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Holy shit. The CERN folk are the edge.
9/21/15, 9:25 AM ~ Alex C~ The physicist in the beginning looks mad chill. Probably vibes to skypewave
9/21/15, 9:31 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Riding chillwaves while unraveling the mysteries of the universe..... So next level auth.
9/21/15, 9:44 AM ~ Sean B~ Damn the really took it to the edge with that
9/21/15, 9:44 AM ~ Sean B~ they*
9/21/15, 9:45 AM ~ Sean B~ Seems like CERN is making strides to stay relevant and improve their brand.  A big improvement over the awkward rapping physicists in particle fever
9/21/15, 9:45 AM ~ Sean B~ Maybe they brought Carles in as a marketing consultant
9/21/15, 9:46 AM ~ Alex C~ Hahaha
9/21/15, 9:47 AM ~ Dave Wu~ The name Carles Sagan popped in my head.
9/21/15, 9:48 AM ~ Sean B~ Yeah that first guy was totally dressed like a hipster version of Sagan too.  Got the beige sport coat but slim and tapered; black t shirt in lieu of a turtleneck
9/21/15, 9:26 PM ~ Alex C~ Whoa, Werner Herzog guest starred in the new Rick and Morty
9/21/15, 9:27 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Oh snap I forgot there was a new Rick and Morty last night

9/22/15, 11:50 AM ~ Sean B~ Haha nice
9/22/15, 10:57 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Caught an episode of bear grylls on BBC. Happened to be the one where he floats off into the sunset with an enema.
9/22/15, 10:58 PM ~ Sean B~ A timeless classic
9/22/15, 10:58 PM ~ Sean B~ One for the ages
9/22/15, 10:59 PM ~ Dave Wu~ 'Just lie back and think of...ugghh... England'

9/23/15, 4:14 PM ~ Dave Wu~ All I could think of was Bill Burrs stand-up but on Bostonian vernacular.
9/23/15, 4:52 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Damn almost everyone in the office is happily heading off to the employee appreciation river cruise. Me... I'm still sitting here buried in a heap of work. But I remember: at least I'm not getting interrupted with questions about lube and plan b. I smile to myself. I guess this is better than the carpet store.
9/23/15, 6:15 PM ~ Sean B~ At least for now until you take Dave off the grid
9/23/15, 6:23 PM ~ Dave Wu~ They really cranked up the realism in Roy II.
9/23/15, 6:26 PM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
9/23/15, 6:27 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha what episode is that from?
9/23/15, 6:29 PM ~ Dave Wu~ It's from the fart saving carpet store mother fucker episode. They mention Roy 2 in the post credit blips and chitz commercial.
9/23/15, 6:29 PM ~ Sean B~ Oh damn I forgot about that
9/23/15, 6:32 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Speaking of Rick and Morty. The Post Rock girl had that in her profile favorites. Mentioned it in my opening message.... Ooooo weeee
9/23/15, 6:32 PM ~ Sean B~ Nice
9/24/15, 11:17 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Listening to hybrid theory at work. So many feels. So long ago.
9/24/15, 11:45 AM ~ Sean B~ It's a classic
9/25/15, 7:20 PM ~ Sean B~ Made it through my Amazon interview day.  And I didn't even have to watch Jeff bezos jerk himself off. 👍
9/26/15, 3:15 PM ~ Alex C~ Haha nice!

9/29/15, 11:28 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Btw Sean if you're getting a suv with a different personal brand. You could look into the Toyota FJ. The car screams 'I am outdoor adventure bro.' Combo that with a pair of Oakley's and you'll probably give of the impression that you crush light beer on the reg.
9/29/15, 11:37 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Lol it looks like the retarded child of a hummer and a tonka truck
9/29/15, 11:41 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Yeah the vehicle caters to a special group of people. Like if you want give of an obnoxious poo brain vibe.
9/29/15, 11:44 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Kids will state at you and the car. And parents will tell them it's not nice to stare, that man obviously has poo brain.
9/29/15, 11:44 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Stare*
9/29/15, 11:51 AM ~ Sean B~ Lol poo brain
9/29/15, 11:52 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Lol
9/29/15, 11:55 AM ~ Sean B~ I've already wrapped up my car search tho.  We pulled the trigger yesterday on a black RAV4.  Practical and understated but rugged enough to facilitate my Outdoorsy Bro rebranding effort.
9/29/15, 11:56 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Ooooo weeeee.... Gotta throw some 22's on it now.

9/29/15, 12:04 PM ~ Sean B~ Nah first thing I'm upgrading is the sound system.  Gotta get some subs so I can wake up the neighborhood with bass heavy mathbonus tracks
9/29/15, 1:42 PM ~ Dave Wu~ You could also be the person that brings whistle tips to the east coast.
9/29/15, 1:51 PM ~ Sean B~ The whistles go wooooo
9/29/15, 7:26 PM ~ Sean B~ Yikes I just got an offer letter from Amazon..
9/29/15, 7:27 PM ~ Sean B~ That's gonna be a tough decision
9/29/15, 7:32 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Mention to my parents that I'm thinking about getting a bike. Basically gets called a dumb idea, gonna get hit by a car, robbed on a trail, etc. Then my dad tells me to learn dancing....WTF is this, some weird reverse footloose shit.
9/29/15, 7:34 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Oh shit dude, I just noticed your Amazon message. Congrats dude. That's some good stuff.
9/29/15, 7:38 PM ~ Alex C~ Yeah, congratulations, Sean!
9/29/15, 7:46 PM ~ Sean B~ Thanks guys.  Not sure if I'll end up taking it but it's definitely a good feeling to have made it all the way with one of the top tech companies.
9/29/15, 7:47 PM ~ Sean B~ Plus now I have leverage to go in and stonewall other companies for more $$$ lol
9/29/15, 7:55 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Now if the hiring manager makes you watch them jerk off, you can just pull out the Amazon letter.
9/29/15, 7:55 PM ~ Sean B~ And then I'll make them watch ME jerk off
9/29/15, 7:59 PM ~ Alex C~ <Media omitted>
9/29/15, 8:13 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Haha. I'm imagining the whole jacking off thing would be covered in the job hunt book: Chapter 17 Negotiation Tactics - Appropriate times to start wanking during an interview and establishing authority by carefully choosing where to nut
9/29/15, 8:14 PM ~ Alex C~ Hahaha
9/29/15, 8:25 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha boo-cake
9/29/15, 8:32 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Oh wow, congrats sean
9/29/15, 8:33 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lol giving it the ol' LBJ
9/29/15, 9:43 PM ~ Sean B~ Thnx brah
9/30/15, 8:44 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Almost wrecked my car this morning dodging some loose carpet rolls lying in the road.... fucking carpet rolls.
9/30/15, 8:59 AM ~ james e mooradian~ That off-white persian
9/30/15, 9:48 AM ~ Sean B~ Lol damn dude Roy is really fuckin up
9/30/15, 12:46 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
9/30/15, 12:46 PM ~ Sean B~ I enjoy how girls on Okc constantly complain about receiving generic/uninteresting messages.  'You should have something to say other than 'hey'', etc.  fair enough.  But then they turn around and do this shit
9/30/15, 12:48 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Yeah because girls know they're holding all the cards.
9/30/15, 12:49 PM ~ Dave Wu~ There's no shortage of dicks, but girls are limited and in high demand
9/30/15, 1:01 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Eh at least guys don't get a never ending supply of dick pics
9/30/15, 1:02 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah and at least we don't have to sit down when we pee or have periods or give birth.  I guess we're still coming out ahead
9/30/15, 1:02 PM ~ Sean B~ Oh yeah and making more money is cool too
9/30/15, 1:48 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Weeooo weeooo
9/30/15, 1:49 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Lol. PC Jim
9/30/15, 1:54 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Yeah I should've clarified my initial statement. Girls are holding all the cards on okc. Okc interface doesn't have a send picture option. Need to get the digits before you can start sending dick Rembrandts.
9/30/15, 1:55 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Hey man, there's always imagination, vivid description, and failing that, ascii art
9/30/15, 2:01 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Ah yes vivid description. Much like the legendary blood ninja.
9/30/15, 2:20 PM ~ Alex C~ OO====D
9/30/15, 2:20 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Heh
9/30/15, 2:21 PM ~ Sean B~ I put on my wizard robe and hat, I cast level 9 Cock Of The Infinite

9/30/15, 2:24 PM ~ Alex C~ 🍆
9/30/15, 2:30 PM ~ Sean B~ I should just start blood ninja-ing girls who message me 'hey.'
9/30/15, 2:30 PM ~ Dave Wu~ 🚹🐎😵
9/30/15, 3:17 PM ~ james e mooradian~ 8===✊D💦
                    😓
9/30/15, 3:17 PM ~ james e mooradian~ You could always give it the ol interview special
9/30/15, 3:34 PM ~ Alex C~ Hahaha man, horse, tragedy, perfect
9/30/15, 3:34 PM ~ Alex C~ Ah and an 8 is how you make the balls! damn, I knew I had it wrong haha
9/30/15, 3:59 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Nice, just got told by a member to go have a stroke. Should have responded with no I'm probably gonna meet my demise in some carpet related accident.
9/30/15, 4:00 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol what
9/30/15, 4:00 PM ~ Sean B~ A member of what?
9/30/15, 4:01 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Member of one of the pharmacy benefit plans
9/30/15, 4:02 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Kinda had to lay down some bad news on the member
9/30/15, 4:20 PM ~ Sean B~ Yikes
9/30/15, 4:20 PM ~ Sean B~ Making grandma eat alpo?
9/30/15, 4:27 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Had to deny a needa need for a stroke patient. But the wasn't related to testing the stroke itself. More like the patient had some nerve issues post stroke. The need could possible be used for those nerve problems but in accordance to gov regs there's not enough support. So I had to deny.
9/30/15, 4:27 PM ~ Sean B~ Poor grandma
9/30/15, 4:28 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Insurance is not making people eat alpo, but more like preventing people from frivolously using meds (especially expensive shit) and making everyone else attached to the plan eat alpo.
9/30/15, 4:29 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Yeesh
9/30/15, 4:42 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Jeez, Morty, you got what the intergalactic call a very planetary mindset.
9/30/15, 4:43 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol
9/30/15, 4:47 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Eek barba dirkle
10/1/15, 1:58 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Had a discussion about how the office would go about letting someone go and the upcoming security preparations. Assessing the risk that said employee would go postal.
10/1/15, 2:03 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Hope y'all say some ridiculous shit on the 6 o'clock news. Like 'Dave... He had a big heart and really cared about people. But boy was he a chronic masturbator and into that strokey chokey shit'
10/1/15, 2:33 PM ~ Alex C~ Hahaha pretty dark humor
10/1/15, 2:40 PM ~ Sean B~ Lolz
10/1/15, 9:57 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
10/1/15, 10:00 PM ~ Sean B~ Not sure if the humor will translate.. But basically everyone on the west coast thinks east cost people are replicas of Bill Burr
10/1/15, 10:01 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lol
10/2/15, 12:29 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
10/2/15, 12:29 PM ~ Sean B~ The whip
10/2/15, 12:32 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Nice. And there's a built in rack that says 'bitch, I do outdoors activities.'
10/2/15, 12:33 PM ~ Sean B~ Exactly
10/2/15, 12:33 PM ~ Sean B~ So much room for activities
10/2/15, 12:42 PM ~ Dave Wu~ You should put rack your bike on the back, attach a kayak to the roof, and slap a couple 26.2 and eat green/organic stickers on the truck.
10/2/15, 12:43 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha yes
10/2/15, 12:43 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Then cruise around Cambridge playing folksy indie music to pick up baguettes
10/2/15, 12:43 PM ~ james e mooradian~ One word dude
10/2/15, 12:43 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Trucknutz
10/2/15, 12:43 PM ~ Sean B~ Brilliant
10/2/15, 12:44 PM ~ Dave Wu~ What about mud flaps with that girl silhouette
10/2/15, 12:44 PM ~ Dave Wu~ 'She looked like the girl on the mud flaps' -Jimmy
10/2/15, 12:44 PM ~ Sean B~ Need a 'no farms no food' bumper sticker. Whatever the hell that's even supposed to mean
10/2/15, 12:44 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol classic
10/2/15, 12:55 PM ~ Dave Wu~ If you go trucknutz and mudflaps, you'd definitely need the Monster energy sticker. Maybe toss in the fox racing for good measure. But that's a whole different set of girls. Like girls that shot guns and maybe went to community college.
10/2/15, 12:56 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Ah painting with broad strokes
10/2/15, 12:56 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah not really the kind of weird I'm looking for
10/3/15, 2:16 PM ~ Alex C~ Sheeuuut, that's a sweet-looking car, Butze
10/3/15, 2:17 PM ~ Sean B~ Thanks :)
10/3/15, 4:07 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I mean you could waited for the new Tesla model but that SUV is still a good choice
10/3/15, 7:43 PM ~ Sean B~ I was told I need to name it.  My first thought was maybe Jake, after jake the dog.  Because he's gonna be my adventure buddy.
10/3/15, 7:47 PM ~ Dave Wu~ The Sneaky Butcher Shop.
10/3/15, 7:49 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha nice
10/3/15, 7:49 PM ~ Sean B~ The Shag Wagon
10/3/15, 7:50 PM ~ Sean B~ The (g)Rape Van
10/4/15, 11:17 AM ~ Sean B~ Whoa apparently john and Charlene got married this weekend
10/4/15, 11:17 AM ~ Sean B~ So says the face books
10/4/15, 12:56 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Oh cool
10/4/15, 12:56 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Guess we didn't get the invite then
10/4/15, 12:56 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol nope guess not
10/4/15, 3:14 PM ~ Dave Wu~ And that's the way the news goes
10/4/15, 3:26 PM ~ Alex C~ Haha, looks like the entirety of 'the weird' went. That's cool though, would you really want to go to a wedding? They've never been my favorite, and less so the less I know the people
10/4/15, 3:30 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lol I mean I've been to a few weddings for people our age. They can be really fun depending on who's getting married
10/4/15, 3:30 PM ~ james e mooradian~ That being said I don't know how much fun a wedding would be with the entirety of 'the weird' as the wedding party
10/4/15, 3:32 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol the weird
10/4/15, 3:33 PM ~ Dave Wu~ They'd probably be calling you 'sprinkles.'
10/4/15, 3:34 PM ~ Sean B~ Wootzy and Boo
10/4/15, 3:34 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Oh yeah... That
10/4/15, 3:35 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Then again that whole perspective thing... Maybe they referred to us as the weird too.
10/4/15, 3:36 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Remember we were so cool back in those days.
10/4/15, 3:39 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah true... But... Let's not forget the penis party
10/4/15, 3:42 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Ah right, so many memories I've left in some dusty recess of my mind.
10/4/15, 3:49 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Oh the places you'll go.......
10/4/15, 3:50 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Fucking sprinkles
10/6/15, 3:28 PM ~ Alex C~ You guys see that noob at uconn who tried to bring booze into the union, proceeded to get into a verbal and finally physical altercation with the union manager, and then got arrested?
10/6/15, 3:35 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol why
10/6/15, 3:35 PM ~ Sean B~ Wut**

10/6/15, 3:47 PM ~ Alex C~ Some guy at the very end goes, 'ooooo-eeee' kind of like Mr. poopy butt hole

10/6/15, 5:18 PM ~ Sean B~ Holy shit.  That was insane
10/6/15, 5:18 PM ~ Sean B~ The dude who took him down is a fuckin hero
10/6/15, 5:19 PM ~ Sean B~ Hope that kid gets expelled.  Don't need these punks diluting the value of my degree

10/7/15, 3:48 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Oh man, I listened to the com truise remix to a tron soundtrack song. Made me remember the time I played it for some of y'all on a car ride back from buckland hills. There were virgin ear canals that couldn't handle the auditory penetration.
10/7/15, 5:39 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol I can't say I remember that
10/7/15, 5:39 PM ~ Sean B~ And....

10/7/15, 5:46 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Happy birthday, Alex!!! 28 damn.
10/7/15, 5:47 PM ~ james e mooradian~ <Media omitted>
10/7/15, 5:47 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Got one of them birthday comix for the occasion
10/7/15, 5:53 PM ~ Alex C~ Haha, thanks guys!
10/7/15, 5:59 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
10/7/15, 5:59 PM ~ Sean B~ Obligatory
10/7/15, 6:04 PM ~ Alex C~ Still makes me laugh each time
10/7/15, 9:14 PM ~ Sean B~ So today I dropped a real triumphant one in my toilet and clogged it real bad.  Plunged it 6 or 7 times, no dice.  Ended up driving to Home Depot to buy a snake. Then came home and had to watch some tutorials on YouTube to learn how to operate it.  Then I had to snake my own toilet, and dislodged a massive turd from deep within.  It was not a pleasant experience. But somewhat proud I finally dropped a David Wu caliber deuce.
10/7/15, 10:39 PM ~ Alex C~ Hahahaha epic
10/7/15, 11:42 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Well now that you own a snake, I don't need to hold back when I visit your place.
10/7/15, 11:43 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Porcelain war crimes
10/8/15, 10:08 AM ~ Sean B~ There will be a strict 'you clog it, you snake it' policy
10/8/15, 11:01 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Haha. You could've also tried in some liqid plumber double penetration before investing in hardware.
10/8/15, 11:02 AM ~ Dave Wu~ And Sean, my beard mentor, said I should post this to the chat. Advice on trimming?
10/8/15, 11:03 AM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
10/8/15, 11:03 AM ~ Sean B~ How effin sexy is that
10/8/15, 12:24 PM ~ Sean B~ Chicks are gonna be frothing at the gash when you walk by
10/8/15, 12:28 PM ~ james e mooradian~ LMAO that might be my new favorite euphemism
10/8/15, 12:29 PM ~ james e mooradian~ But yeah I really like Dave's look with the haircut/beard combo
10/8/15, 12:35 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah the haircut is nice too. Combined with a crisp button down, you really look like a guy who handles serious business
10/8/15, 12:35 PM ~ Sean B~ 'I am a man, and I know how to do things'
10/8/15, 1:30 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Sigh... The meeting I get left out of, there's free lunch and a bunch of hot vendors presenting. Meanwhile I'm holding down the daily work and eating the remnants from their breakfast.
10/8/15, 1:31 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Well they're just gonna get the bare minimum from me today
10/9/15, 10:32 AM ~ Sean B~ Haha nice way to stick it to the man
10/9/15, 12:05 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Wish one of y'all owned a dog (preferably a puppy). Need to up my tinder photo game.
10/9/15, 12:11 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Or maybe a bunch of baby ducks
10/9/15, 12:45 PM ~ Sean B~ You could visit a pet store
10/9/15, 12:46 PM ~ james e mooradian~ You could take a picture with my aloe plant. You're its primary caretaker as it is
10/9/15, 12:47 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Horticulture can be sexy too
10/9/15, 12:54 PM ~ Dave Wu~ At the shelter: 'Sir, You gonna adopt all these dogs' 'Nah, fuck that shit... just hurry up and take the photo for my tinder.'
10/9/15, 1:01 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Pretty store or a petting zoo woiuld be a good idea. Also what up with all the profiles with the 'better not be holding a fish' disclaimer
10/9/15, 1:03 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha yeah... Apparently lots of guys have photos of themselves holding a fish they caught.  What a bunch of basic tools
10/9/15, 2:56 PM ~ Dave Wu~ And the girls with inspirational quotes in their description. For fucks sake, I'm not looking for office posters on tinder
10/9/15, 4:56 PM ~ Alex C~ <Media omitted>
10/9/15, 4:59 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Haha nice. They let you keep your old license? DMV took my old one when I renewed.
10/9/15, 5:00 PM ~ Alex C~ Yeah, it was weird, maybe because I went to AAA they let me keep it
10/9/15, 5:04 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I still try to tap B whenever the evolution alerts comes up in life.
10/9/15, 5:11 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Kinda like pickachu refusing to evolve. But then Ash forces his way later in the show with a lightening stone suppository.
10/9/15, 5:15 PM ~ Alex C~ Hahaha
10/9/15, 9:56 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Hahaha this is great

10/10/15, 12:03 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Lol. That idiot degree... Money well spent.
10/10/15, 12:04 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Also Jim thanks for the 5 min butt dial
10/10/15, 11:50 AM ~ Dave Wu~ That moment when you realize you qualify for a 22 year old's 'looking for someone older' age range.
10/10/15, 11:52 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Lmao was it another Kelly Byrne magnum opus?

10/12/15, 12:33 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Bitch lost her birth control. Bitch needs an override for lost birth control. Bitch says it's an emergency. Bitch needs to get creampied asap.
10/12/15, 1:30 PM ~ Sean B~ Geez man that's a little harsh don't ya think
10/12/15, 1:39 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Sorry, I'm manning the call center and clinical office by myself.  Wish I had a Meeseeks box right now or I'm about to reach Morty purge level
10/12/15, 4:55 PM ~ Sean B~ Sounds like fun
10/12/15, 4:57 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Damn man, that sounds shitty. If you wanna grab a drink/blow off steam let me know

10/14/15, 2:30 PM ~ james e mooradian~ You should just grab the first and last page and fill the rest with with foreclosure auctions and police blotters
10/15/15, 10:38 AM ~ Dave Wu~ That awkward moment when your boss is talking to you and notices the dating app open on your phone.
10/16/15, 4:25 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I was looking through a scope of work for one of our projects today and there's a personnel category called 'Expert BM Consultant'
10/16/15, 4:26 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I laughed way more than I probably should have thinking about some guy in a punstripe suit teaching people how to get nothing but net every time
10/21/15, 12:46 PM ~ Sean B~ http://existentialcomics.com/comic/99

10/25/15, 3:29 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha thanks
10/25/15, 3:29 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah the squared edges are somewhat divisive but I like it. I get a lot of compliments  which is cool
10/25/15, 3:30 PM ~ james e mooradian~ It's tough when it gets to that length for sure
10/25/15, 3:30 PM ~ james e mooradian~ You gotta contend with it puffing out too much on the sides
10/25/15, 3:30 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah I keep the sides tight.  That's the key
10/25/15, 3:31 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I bet it looks pretty sweet from straight on
10/25/15, 3:31 PM ~ james e mooradian~ That business beard
10/25/15, 3:31 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I think I'm reaching the sean puffy combs stage
10/25/15, 3:33 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
10/25/15, 3:34 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Looks like that guy did a business.
10/25/15, 3:34 PM ~ Sean B~ Went to the stock market and did a business
10/25/15, 4:23 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lol nice pic dude
10/25/15, 4:24 PM ~ james e mooradian~ You look like you'd fit in perfectly in the Seattle/Portland metropolitan region
10/25/15, 4:25 PM ~ Sean B~ Thanks.  Yeah that's my goal
10/25/15, 4:27 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Off to a good start I'd say. Not sure if you mentioned it but I take it you turned down the amazon offer?
10/25/15, 4:28 PM ~ Sean B~ I got my deadline extended.  But I'm most likely gonna turn it down.  I'm also interviewing at Google in California in a couple weeks.
10/25/15, 4:29 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Oh damn man, good luck
10/25/15, 4:30 PM ~ Sean B~ Thanks
10/25/15, 4:30 PM ~ Sean B~ How's your job hunt going
10/25/15, 4:31 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Eh I don't know. Slow as shit I guess
10/25/15, 4:31 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Had a second round a week and a half ago, think it went well but haven't heard anything since
10/25/15, 4:32 PM ~ james e mooradian~ It's just tough to find a decent tech job in NYC
10/25/15, 4:32 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Might have to just go straight into finance or to something a little more entry level
10/25/15, 4:34 PM ~ Sean B~ Hmm yeah that's frustrating
10/25/15, 4:35 PM ~ Sean B~ Maybe be a quant for a hedge fund and just go all wolf of Wall Street
10/25/15, 4:35 PM ~ Sean B~ Dropping ludes on the reg
10/25/15, 4:35 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lol yeah its always an option
10/25/15, 4:35 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Hookers on a private jet
10/25/15, 4:36 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Sounds boring as shit though
10/25/15, 4:36 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I mean aside from the late 90s era hedonism
10/25/15, 4:38 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha yeah
10/25/15, 4:41 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Eh I guess you never know. There's always those tech bootcamps if I gotta make something work
10/25/15, 4:41 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Wouldn't mind checking out the Seattle area if it came to that tbh
10/25/15, 4:41 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Seems pretty relevant
10/25/15, 4:42 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah there's a lot of those around.  Surprised there's not more demand for your stats skillz though.  Thought people were fiending for data people
10/25/15, 4:43 PM ~ james e mooradian~ For every 20 or so cool sounding openings on the west coast there's like one in NYC
10/25/15, 4:43 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Most are looking for senior data scientists far as I can tell
10/25/15, 4:43 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Like a finance firm trying to retrofit the past 15 years of tech research
10/25/15, 4:44 PM ~ Sean B~ Hmm interesting
10/25/15, 4:44 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Looking more and more at business days analyst and quant style positions
10/25/15, 6:37 PM ~ james e mooradian~ So in other news, I've been in a sports bar for the past 6-7 hours
10/25/15, 6:37 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Watching sports
10/25/15, 6:37 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I wanna go home so bsd
10/25/15, 6:38 PM ~ Sean B~ That sounds like a fuckin nightmare
10/25/15, 6:40 PM ~ james e mooradian~ It's about as fun as it sounds
10/25/15, 6:40 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Damn that's painful

10/27/15, 10:14 AM ~ Dave Wu~ And looking back at 8 years ago us, there such a vast difference in life goals and beards.
10/27/15, 10:28 AM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
10/27/15, 10:31 AM ~ james e mooradian~ That you're an adult but you know how to have fun?
10/27/15, 10:31 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Don't really know where to place the communist manifesto
10/27/15, 11:05 AM ~ Sean B~ Suggestion #4: 50 Shades of Grey
10/27/15, 11:12 AM ~ Dave Wu~ This is still better than the week I had suggestions for garage door openers, faucets, and lawn tools.
10/28/15, 10:23 AM ~ Dave Wu~ The combined disappointment from house hunting and online dating is reaching a breaking point. About to say fuck it all and move to the woods or open a ladies footlocker.
10/28/15, 10:31 AM ~ Sean B~ I feels you man.
10/28/15, 10:31 AM ~ Sean B~ I was on such a hot streak just a few weeks ago only to have it all fall apart within a matter of days
10/28/15, 10:32 AM ~ Sean B~ Really don't understand how people enjoy the single life.  So much constant disappointment
10/28/15, 10:32 AM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
10/29/15, 12:19 PM ~ Sean B~ So I was recently contacted by a game development company who was interested in using one of my songs in the opening credits of an upcoming game.  Just negotiated a small contract with them.  The game is gonna be coming out on Steam in a few months I think.  Pretty stoked about that.
10/29/15, 12:20 PM ~ Sean B~ http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=405651316
10/29/15, 1:36 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Nice, stacking them flurbos.
10/29/15, 4:28 PM ~ Sean B~ Yup.  Time to hit the VIP and pop some Cystale
10/29/15, 4:36 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Or do lines of collaxion crystal dust off a stripper's ass.
10/30/15, 3:40 PM ~ Sean B~ MRW a girl on Okc who's 5'6' says 'you must be at least 6 foot' in her profile http://giphy.com/gifs/a3zqvrH40Cdhu
10/30/15, 3:49 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lolz what bs
10/30/15, 3:49 PM ~ james e mooradian~ To be honest I thought you were gonna link that picture of the hamster with the banana
10/30/15, 3:55 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha yeah that one would also apply
10/30/15, 4:48 PM ~ Dave Wu~ She must love to laugh.
10/30/15, 4:49 PM ~ Sean B~ Oh you know it.  And watching Netflix.
10/30/15, 7:20 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Sounds so laid back and down to earth.
11/1/15, 11:05 AM ~ Dave Wu~ My mom tells the realtor I'd have a hard time kicking out the current tenants to increase rent because I have a soft heart.
11/1/15, 11:35 AM ~ Sean B~ LOL
11/1/15, 4:15 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>

11/4/15, 8:54 AM ~ Dave Wu~ What happened to whole UConn is having budget issues thing?
11/4/15, 8:54 AM ~ Sean B~ Did they tear down the old dorms?
11/4/15, 9:03 AM ~ Alex C~ No, there just behind the new one
11/4/15, 9:09 AM ~ Sean B~ Packin em in there like livestock
11/4/15, 9:10 AM ~ Sean B~ Also nice to see you back on the thread. Was starting to think maybe you took Roy off the grid
11/4/15, 9:11 AM ~ Alex C~ Had an experiment last week that took me off the grid for a while
11/4/15, 9:29 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Hope that dissertation research is coming along nicely dude
11/4/15, 9:30 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Hopefully you can defend before UConn grows into that city from judge dredd
11/4/15, 10:01 AM ~ Alex C~ Me too, luckily this last experiment went pretty well
11/10/15, 12:44 PM ~ Sean B~ Interviewing at Google today! Wubbalubbadubbdubbbb I'm Tiny Rick
11/10/15, 12:46 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Good luck. That's how you should open up the interview too.
11/10/15, 12:59 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol that'd be awesome
11/12/15, 9:19 PM ~ Alex C~ Butze, you end up clowning on that interview?
11/12/15, 9:49 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha... I dunno. It was difficult.  4 technical interviews, 45 min each. Hard to tell if I did well or not.  We'll see what happens
11/13/15, 6:33 PM ~ Alex C~ <Media omitted>
11/13/15, 6:41 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha nice
11/14/15, 12:02 PM ~ Dave Wu~ An older dude just asked me what's the 'best way to remove hair from the genitals.' He brought his lady friend too.
11/14/15, 12:37 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol
11/14/15, 12:37 PM ~ Sean B~ You'd think he should know that by now
11/14/15, 2:30 PM ~ Dave Wu~ The guy wanted to rub hair removal cream on his balls. Smooth as eggs.
11/14/15, 2:31 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha.  So funny story about that... I actually tried that once in high school.  It burned so fucking bad lol never do it
11/14/15, 2:35 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Jesus. That's some inbetweeners shit right there.
11/14/15, 3:06 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha yeah...
11/17/15, 4:29 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
11/17/15, 4:30 PM ~ Sean B~ Seen in a classroom today
11/17/15, 4:34 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Wubba lubba dub dub!!!
11/18/15, 10:20 AM ~ Dave Wu~ So today I had to google a letter format for some loan documents. Ended up finding info on a credit score forum. Normally, I see posts with flair like lists of prior phones on a smartphone group, computer specs for gaming, car upgrades, or other hobby/rl achievement stuff. On the credit forum, people listed credit scores as flair. It was kinda surreal. Always thought credit scores was something you keep to yourself.
11/18/15, 11:28 AM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha wow
11/18/15, 11:33 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Niche forums are strange places
11/18/15, 11:33 AM ~ james e mooradian~ I bet that's like a candy store for identity theives
11/18/15, 12:51 PM ~ Sean B~ Can only imagine the kind of vapid, hollow existence one has to live in order for their credit score to be the thing they brag about / discuss extensively on Internet forums
11/18/15, 4:04 PM ~ james e mooradian~ So I got an email today from Elsevier saying my thesis paper is the number one most cited article for alternative methods in crash injury severity modelling
11/18/15, 4:04 PM ~ james e mooradian~ That degree is really paying dividends
11/18/15, 4:06 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Is that the thesis you wrote in 24 hours?
11/18/15, 4:07 PM ~ Sean B~ Damn that's cool
11/18/15, 4:11 PM ~ james e mooradian~ That's the one I wrote my first year of grad school
11/18/15, 4:11 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I'm honestly surprised there are more than like 2 or 3 papers on that specific topic, to be honest
11/18/15, 4:12 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I doubt it means anything to me other than a little boost of self esteem, but still. Feels good man
11/18/15, 4:15 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
11/18/15, 4:20 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Time to let the cdm office know what's up. Go to work with no pants on. Be like, I'm number one on the citation charts. I do whatever I feel.
11/18/15, 4:20 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Hahaha
11/18/15, 4:21 PM ~ james e mooradian~ 'Lick-lick-lick my balls!!'
11/18/15, 4:21 PM ~ Sean B~ That's the waaaaayyy the news goes
11/18/15, 4:23 PM ~ Dave Wu~ AIDS!
11/18/15, 4:24 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Such a good show dude
11/18/15, 4:25 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Still name occasional temporary variables after Mr poopybutthole in my traffic assignment scripts
11/18/15, 4:25 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol nice
11/18/15, 4:26 PM ~ Sean B~ I also get down with the R&M references in my code
11/18/15, 4:27 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
11/18/15, 4:28 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Haha awesome
11/18/15, 4:30 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
11/18/15, 4:31 PM ~ Sean B~ Cheap thrills. Gotta do what you can to break the crushing monotony.
11/18/15, 4:32 PM ~ james e mooradian~ That's what life is all about, I guess
11/18/15, 4:33 PM ~ Sean B~ Yup we're all basically just passing the butter.  Might as well make it interesting
11/18/15, 4:33 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Hahaha always laugh when I'm reminded of that poor guy
11/18/15, 4:33 PM ~ james e mooradian~ But yeah
11/18/15, 4:35 PM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
11/18/15, 4:38 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol wtf
11/18/15, 4:40 PM ~ Dave Wu~ That's just the tip of the iceberg for weird medical diagnosis codes. I guess this one is like a butthole Charlie horse.
11/18/15, 4:41 PM ~ Dave Wu~ And it treated with meds that literally relax the ass.
11/18/15, 4:49 PM ~ Sean B~ Relax your ass and spread ya cheeks
11/18/15, 5:35 PM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
11/18/15, 5:40 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol wow
11/20/15, 2:55 PM ~ Sean B~ Got rejected by Google 😞. Guess that's just the way the news goes.
11/20/15, 3:14 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Bummer dude. I guess the bright side is you won't have to pay San Francisco rents.
11/20/15, 3:18 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah I'm actually kind of relieved.  Wasn't too psyched about the idea of living there and paying retarded rent for a shoebox apartment.  Still would have been nice to get an offer though.
11/20/15, 3:19 PM ~ Sean B~ Man their hiring bar is like soooo fuckin high though.  I knew it was high but like god damn. The recruiter did me the courtesy of reading through all 4 of my interviewers' feedback detailing every mistake and shortcoming of my solutions.
11/20/15, 3:20 PM ~ Sean B~ Like cool bro thanks
11/20/15, 3:20 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Jesus. That's rough.
11/20/15, 3:21 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Damn man. Sorry to hear that but yeah everything I hear about Google interviews is pretty similar. They've got a really high false negative rate though so you can always apply a little later
11/20/15, 3:21 PM ~ Sean B~ And I was like 'ok but can they freestyle rap in a Scottish accent? ... Didn't think so'
11/20/15, 3:23 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Lol. All those Google perks and cafes can't hold a candle to that.
11/20/15, 3:23 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Guess you should start your own company and make that internet money.
11/20/15, 3:24 PM ~ Sean B~ They really can't
11/20/15, 3:24 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah man.  Someday I just might.  Gotta get a little more experience fire
11/20/15, 3:24 PM ~ Sean B~ First*
11/20/15, 3:31 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I seem to remember a webcomic along those lines
11/20/15, 3:33 PM ~ james e mooradian~ <Media omitted>
11/20/15, 3:40 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha
11/20/15, 3:41 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah that's spot on
11/20/15, 6:33 PM ~ Dave Wu~ We'll all eventually become what we used to hate.
11/20/15, 6:40 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I like to think of it more as the racism/prejudice/liberal-conservative cycle
11/20/15, 6:41 PM ~ james e mooradian~ The views we have as reasonably liberal folks may just become conservative for the new generation
11/20/15, 6:41 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Maybe the values we have will just become obsolete in the eyes of the youths
11/20/15, 6:41 PM ~ james e mooradian~ ..damn youths
11/20/15, 8:17 PM ~ Alex C~ Dang, for some reason I wasn't getting message notifications from WhatsApp so I thought everything was just wicked quiet for the past couple days. Turns out I missed like 80 messages including those hilarious R&M references in lines of code haha
11/20/15, 8:18 PM ~ Alex C~ Also, just found this stand up segment I thought you guys would appreciate http://www.cc.com/video-clips/j2epun/the-meltdown-with-jonah-and-kumail-uncensored---extended---sad-snacks-and-sad-tweets
11/20/15, 8:18 PM ~ Alex C~ Dude does a bit called 'how my day sounds towards the middle that I couldn't stop laughing at
11/20/15, 8:21 PM ~ Alex C~ Actually it's closer to the end of the clip
11/20/15, 8:25 PM ~ Sean B~ Welcome back.  Thought you went off the grid again
11/21/15, 1:44 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Watching food factory on TV. Noticed they play some ill trap beats during the slow-mo machine food porn scenes.
11/21/15, 1:47 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha nice
11/21/15, 1:47 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Hope they use a compilation of 2 second clips to make it super legit
11/21/15, 2:04 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Yeah super legit. Never thought Gorton's fish fillets were so ballin.
11/21/15, 2:16 PM ~ Sean B~ They should sign a deal with mathbonus
11/23/15, 1:49 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Lately my targeted Google mail ads have changed from 'Single? Try Zoosk' to 'House hunting? Get pre-qualified with Wells Fargo.'
11/23/15, 1:49 PM ~ Dave Wu~ targeted ads*
11/23/15, 7:43 PM ~ Alex C~ Are you getting closer to buying something?
11/23/15, 9:08 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I'm closing on a place on Dec 18th, so all my Google ads are all mortgage related. No more 'single guy who wants to attend Lincoln tech while driving ubers for $1500' a week ads.
11/23/15, 11:40 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha nice
11/23/15, 11:40 PM ~ Sean B~ That's super exciting though
11/23/15, 11:41 PM ~ Sean B~ You should throw an epic drug-fueled rager before the tenants move in
11/23/15, 11:42 PM ~ Sean B~ Maybe hire the Get Wet Girls
11/24/15, 9:46 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Yeah dunno if you'd wanna be in East Somerville just yet. It's up and coming, as my realtor says, 'they still speak Portuguese in the area.' And I'm receiving the place with some tenants. My living space is the trap house basement.
But don't worry, I'll make sure the get wet girls make an appearance at one of y'allz stag parties.
11/24/15, 9:54 AM ~ Alex C~ With the toy show too!? Can't wait!
11/24/15, 9:57 AM ~ Dave Wu~ For you, Alex, I'll make sure you get the 'I think I need to join a cloistered monastery' special.
11/24/15, 10:03 AM ~ Sean B~ For my stag I'm gonna need a hang glider and a crotchless Uncle Sam suit.  Fill an entire football field with redheads and the stands with anyone who looks remotely like my father.
11/24/15, 10:19 AM ~ Alex C~ Hahahaha
11/24/15, 10:31 AM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
11/24/15, 10:36 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Lol
11/24/15, 11:37 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Today I learned that I manage pharmacy benefits for T Boone Pickens.... Guy's not exactly a light weight.
11/24/15, 11:53 AM ~ Sean B~ Wow
11/24/15, 2:38 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Everyone was like make sure an approval happens and what not. Don't wanna step on his toes because he probably rips orifices like a portal gun.

11/27/15, 3:20 PM ~ Sean B~ Please tell me your dad commissioned a Chinese man to carve it by hand and shipped it from Shanghai
11/27/15, 3:20 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Oh snap, is that from the local Vermont chainsaw bear carver dude?
11/27/15, 3:21 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Damn dude that's really gonna tie the house together
11/27/15, 3:22 PM ~ Sean B~ It almost begs the question, how much more awesome can the house get? And the answer is none.  None more awesome.
11/27/15, 3:25 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I dunno, if Alex's dad decides to start a brewery operation I'd have a hard time being disappointed in the turn of events
11/27/15, 3:25 PM ~ james e mooradian~ That house is like countable infinity
11/27/15, 3:25 PM ~ Sean B~ True
11/27/15, 3:25 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha
11/27/15, 3:28 PM ~ Sean B~ The Limit Does Not Exist
11/27/15, 3:53 PM ~ Alex C~ Haha If you look closely, you'll see that it's holding a beer mug. My dad had it carved by this guy in Chester. You know the house with the huge mailbox? That guy. He's also made a bunch of beats for Steven Tyler. The guy's name is, I shit you not, Barry. Barry the bear-carving guy. He does it with a chainsaw
11/27/15, 3:55 PM ~ Sean B~ That is truly epic
11/28/15, 7:36 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
11/28/15, 7:36 PM ~ Sean B~ (girl I've been seeing)
11/28/15, 7:58 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Ooooo weee..looks like you found something special there.
11/28/15, 8:22 PM ~ Alex C~ Wow, what a catch
11/29/15, 12:58 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Holiday shopping makes me feel like dying.
11/29/15, 2:47 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah
11/29/15, 3:17 PM ~ Alex C~ Most holiday shoppers probably feel that way. I was feeling like that the other day. Luckily I happened to chance upon the movie Flash Gordon plying on the TV, which cheered me right up. Have you guys seen that one? It's hilarious. Maybe even better than Conan the Destroyer
11/29/15, 4:07 PM ~ Sean B~ Nice.  No haven't seen it
11/29/15, 4:07 PM ~ Sean B~ It's like a super cheesy 80s action movie right
11/29/15, 4:10 PM ~ Alex C~ Yeah, the hero has no super powers, he's just the quarterback for the New York Jets. He uses some of his football skills to fight aliens
11/29/15, 9:26 PM ~ Dave Wu~ So I noticed on FB it's Pam's birthday. And she posted a photo with Noelle about how 8 years ago they packed 45 people in a dorm room. That was the Pam-palooza. Wow, that was a long time ago.
11/29/15, 9:29 PM ~ Dave Wu~ That was also the same night Butze and I got rigety rigety wrecked, drew dicks on most of the 5th floor white boards, and watched swap.avi. So cool... We were so cool. Also I've never fully recovered from the swap trauma.
11/29/15, 10:31 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha wow yeah that was quite a night
12/1/15, 2:17 PM ~ Alex C~ http://youtu.be/Hy8efX9fviQ
12/1/15, 2:17 PM ~ Alex C~ Have you guys seen these? It's James Joyce's love letters to his wife.
12/1/15, 2:18 PM ~ Alex C~ Full of b-hole references
12/1/15, 2:25 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Jezus. James mother fuckin Joyce loving that butt stuff.
12/1/15, 2:28 PM ~ Alex C~ Haha, I love all the different ways he describes farts
12/1/15, 2:32 PM ~ Dave Wu~ He got into all the subtleties of farting. Must've been a real fart connoisseur.
12/1/15, 2:32 PM ~ Sean B~ Man I can't wait to watch this when I get home later
12/1/15, 2:32 PM ~ Alex C~ Smart feller and fart smeller
12/1/15, 3:42 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Oh wow there's other videos/ letters. Damn, Jimmy Joyce you nasty.
12/1/15, 3:43 PM ~ Alex C~ Yeah, it's a hilarious series
12/2/15, 10:51 AM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
12/2/15, 10:51 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Did you take a sad pause and tell them that he's a close family friend?
12/2/15, 10:52 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Haha
12/2/15, 10:53 AM ~ Dave Wu~ I told her it's from Rick and Morty. And she said her niece actually does animation for the show out in California.
12/2/15, 11:20 AM ~ Sean B~ Nice
12/2/15, 11:53 AM ~ Alex C~ Cool, small world

12/3/15, 7:39 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Sounds like me.
12/3/15, 7:40 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol my friend just sent that to me.  So awesome
12/3/15, 8:20 PM ~ Alex C~ Haha perfect
12/3/15, 8:22 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lol at this point I think that's all of us
12/4/15, 4:17 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Left regular show on in the office lunch room... The little things.
12/4/15, 4:41 PM ~ Sean B~ Nice
12/4/15, 7:44 PM ~ Alex C~ <Media omitted>
12/4/15, 7:47 PM ~ Sean B~ Damn that is awesome
12/4/15, 7:47 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Whoa. I feel basic.
12/4/15, 7:49 PM ~ Alex C~ Maths, it's pretty sweet
12/4/15, 7:50 PM ~ Sean B~ https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_RD6rigX0Eo
12/4/15, 7:51 PM ~ Alex C~ Hahaha exactly
12/4/15, 8:24 PM ~ james e mooradian~ That's pretty sweet
12/4/15, 8:24 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Very impressive hand drafting skills too
12/4/15, 8:27 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Does volume to surface area apply here? I'm pretty bad with theoretical maths
12/4/15, 8:28 PM ~ Sean B~ In what way?
12/4/15, 8:31 PM ~ Sean B~ I think the original proof was basically concerned with magnitudes of infinite sets.  Basically showing that the infinite quantity of all real numbers is equal to that of any subset. Which is crazy cool
12/4/15, 8:32 PM ~ Sean B~ https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph_number
12/4/15, 8:37 PM ~ Alex C~ Each line in the lower half corresponds to a half circle in the top half. The diameter of each circle corresponds to the interval from 0 to 1 on the circle's corresponding line. A line is drawn from each circle's midpoint to a point outside of the interval from 0 to 1. Where that line intersects the circle, a line is drawn from the intersection to the circles diameter such that that line and the diameter are perpendicular. That process, which maps a point outside of the interval to exactly one point inside the interval can be repeatedly for all of the infinite points on the real line outside of the interval. Therefore, the mapping is one to one and the infinity of points inside the interval is exactly equal to the infinity of points outside of the interval (in mathspeak, they have the same 'cardinality'). For each half circle, I've drawn 4 example mappings. Then I repeat the drawing using the previous drawing as the 0 to 1 interval is the next. That way the nesting of Infinities becomes more obvious.
12/4/15, 8:46 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Makes for some pretty sweet album art too
12/4/15, 8:46 PM ~ Sean B~ So cool. You're nerd level is like uncountably infinite.
12/4/15, 8:47 PM ~ Sean B~ Your*
12/4/15, 9:10 PM ~ james e mooradian~ It's all really cool stuff. I'm pretty noobish when it comes to any math that's not applied, but the idea of a smaller scale universe with lower energy seems pretty neat
12/4/15, 9:10 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I figure the physics works out somehow

12/7/15, 11:38 AM ~ Sean B~ Yeah.  Come a long way from blacking out and chasing people around in a parking lot with a knife
12/7/15, 2:13 PM ~ Dave Wu~ We did personality tests for a team building exercise. Was all out objective thinker but totally bottomed out in the pessimist/aloof/reticent department. Basically I'll get the job done right but I gives zero fucks about team feelings lol.

12/7/15, 3:33 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
12/7/15, 8:16 PM ~ Alex C~ Is #buttstuff a movement?
12/7/15, 8:21 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Movement of stuff in and around the butthole.
12/7/15, 8:22 PM ~ Alex C~ Haha was wondering why it was a pretty professional sticker and also why it was a hashtag. Was butt stuff trending?
12/8/15, 10:43 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Details are a little hazy, but I had a dream where we got a bunch of strippers and had a deep philosophical conversation with them.
12/8/15, 10:47 AM ~ Dave Wu~ And to answer your question, Alex,

12/10/15, 9:11 PM ~ Sean B~ Ok cool I will
12/10/15, 9:11 PM ~ Sean B~ Thanks for inviting us. It was awesome last year
12/10/15, 9:21 PM ~ Alex C~ Great, should be a lot of the same group this year, so it should be pretty fun again

12/13/15, 7:48 PM ~ Alex C~ http://youtu.be/LoWCMzHWlRk
12/13/15, 10:41 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha that's amazing.  He should have his own cooking show
12/14/15, 9:56 AM ~ Alex C~ I was thinking the exact same thing, 'Go Fuck Yourself: Cooking with Billy Red Face'
12/14/15, 10:20 AM ~ Sean B~ I could watch him demonstrate just about anything
12/14/15, 12:29 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I need bill burr to come in my office and demo stamps.com.
12/14/15, 12:31 PM ~ Dave Wu~ For real, we keep running out of stamps and having to make runs to the post office.
12/14/15, 12:32 PM ~ Sean B~ lol

12/15/15, 5:26 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha nice
12/16/15, 9:43 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Prescribed calls are always hilarious when I have nurse coming through the headset on one ear and DMX playing in the other ear.
12/16/15, 9:44 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Especially when the nurse gives me wrong info and DMX punctuates with 'you think this is a game!!!'
12/16/15, 9:54 AM ~ Sean B~ Woof woof!

12/18/15, 9:05 PM ~ Dave Wu~ When I see Christmas lights strung up in the neighborhood, I don't think about Christmas hogwash. Rather, I remember the time we spelled Prudence with lights and we were the cool kids... Good times.
12/18/15, 9:08 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I honestly was a huge fan of those Christmas lights. The blow up Santa's/frosty the snowmen, not so much
12/18/15, 9:09 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Hey man, now that you're an official homeowner, you can continue the tradition of gaudy Christmas decoration
12/18/15, 9:10 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Maybe give it a festive 'holiday booyah' theme
12/18/15, 9:11 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Like one of those blinking motion light setups, where a nutsack made of lights goes in and out of a butthole
12/18/15, 9:12 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Maybe you can do one of those music synced l
Xmas light shows
12/18/15, 9:22 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Lol. No Christmas lights for the place. It's an ugly rear unit building. Strictly clear heels updates.
12/18/15, 9:37 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Hey this is Aru. When are you having your slumlord house party?!?! I volunteer jmmys place for the venue....
12/18/15, 10:51 PM ~ Sean B~ Prudennnncee

12/19/15, 8:59 PM ~ Alex C~ Amazing, love when the lady was like 'we got the lyrics to Rudolph' and X was like 'bitch, please! I know the damn lyrics! *bark *bark'
12/20/15, 1:59 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Lol DMX.
12/20/15, 1:59 PM ~ Dave Wu~ And I just noticed Aru's post. Hope she didn't read any other posts in the thread.
12/20/15, 6:36 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Damn, just did my intro call to my tenant. The seriousness of this endeavor finally hit me. I feel like I should out on some real pants.
12/21/15, 2:27 PM ~ Sean B~ Your adult game is so strong right now
12/21/15, 4:37 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Damn man that's a pretty big 'successful adult' moment
12/21/15, 4:37 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I'm pretty sure Aru is okay with our level of humor
12/21/15, 5:22 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I don't know about this 'successful adult' thing. All the stress, coffee, and fast-food/office Christmas dessert meals; really been taking a toll on my field goal percentage. Been Shaq-ing the porcelain.
12/21/15, 7:07 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
12/21/15, 7:51 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Nice. Where's that rock?
12/21/15, 8:13 PM ~ Sean B~ Brooklyn boulders. The gym near my place
12/22/15, 3:26 PM ~ james e mooradian~ You guys see that new star wars movie yet?
12/22/15, 3:26 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Just gotta say, it was super weird watching Sean's old profile pic as a sith lord
12/22/15, 3:34 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Darth Sneaky Butcher?
12/22/15, 3:40 PM ~ Dave Wu~ But haven't seen it yet. Heard it was good. Though I'm afraid I'm gonna be thinking about cabbage patch doll lunchboxes when kylo ren appears.
12/22/15, 3:44 PM ~ Sean B~ I'm seeing it tomorrow.  Didn't know that dude was in it
12/22/15, 5:49 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lol yeah I mean it's not a spoiler or anything but it was jarring as fuck when you see his face
12/22/15, 5:49 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Just imagining him from girls
12/22/15, 5:49 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Being creepy as ever
12/23/15, 7:32 PM ~ Sean B~ Saw Star Wars today.  Yeah it was decent but Adam Driver as the villain definitely didn't work.  Maybe if I hadn't seen girls and watched him jizz on Lena Dunham
12/23/15, 8:05 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Any film or show he appears in I just think cabbage patch whisperer.
12/23/15, 8:07 PM ~ Sean B~ Some things you just can't un-see

12/24/15, 11:15 AM ~ Sean B~ Nice.  And two other units above?
12/24/15, 11:16 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Three. The basement is an illegal 4th attached to unit 1
12/24/15, 11:20 AM ~ Sean B~ Aww sheeut.  Dat cash flow
12/24/15, 11:20 AM ~ Sean B~ Maybe you should start a brothel.
12/24/15, 11:22 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Rubs and tizzugs

12/25/15, 8:14 AM ~ Dave Wu~ 'Just dump and slow cook' That's my technique when I clog the toilet and avoid grabbing the plunger.
12/25/15, 10:40 AM ~ Sean B~ Yeah can't wait to try it out.  That Cathy Mitchell looks like she knows a thing or two about dumps
12/25/15, 10:47 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Crockpots are great for making bachelor chow.
12/25/15, 10:49 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Curious about Cathy's dump cakes
12/25/15, 10:52 AM ~ Sean B~ Sounds like something from urban dictionary

12/25/15, 4:12 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Wait what is going on in that card?
12/25/15, 4:12 PM ~ james e mooradian~ There's someone else in the bed
12/25/15, 4:12 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I thought it was one of those 'excited to get up on christ morning' kind of things
12/25/15, 4:14 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I guess it's a Christmas B and E featuring animated Sean
12/25/15, 4:19 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
12/25/15, 4:19 PM ~ james e mooradian~ That's amazing
12/25/15, 5:35 PM ~ Alex C~ Hahaha just read this string of messages. That custom bitmoji is hilarious
12/25/15, 5:51 PM ~ Sean B~ You guys should all make one.  It's fucking hilarious
12/25/15, 6:03 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Was gonna say it seems a little basic, but then again I just made a Pinterest.
12/25/15, 6:38 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol yeah it's kinda basic but
12/25/15, 6:38 PM ~ Sean B~ it's so fun though
12/25/15, 9:53 PM ~ Alex C~ <Media omitted>

12/26/15, 8:17 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Dang that Mr poopybutthole emoji looks like a cancer patient with liver failure.
12/26/15, 8:27 AM ~ Sean B~ Haha nice!
12/26/15, 9:10 AM ~ Sean B~ Look at all these zany characters.  It's like a Where's Waldo in here
12/26/15, 9:50 AM ~ james e mooradian~ lol

12/26/15, 10:38 AM ~ Alex C~ these are pretty fun
12/26/15, 10:39 AM ~ Sean B~ I know.  Endless entertainment
12/26/15, 10:42 AM ~ Alex C~ Still laughing at dave's description of Jimmy's mr. Poopybutthole
12/26/15, 1:09 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
12/26/15, 1:10 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Marty McFly is fucked
12/26/15, 1:15 PM ~ Dave Wu~ It's the point in human history when legs became vestigial appendages.
12/26/15, 4:22 PM ~ Alex C~ So when you guys coming up to VT?
12/26/15, 4:44 PM ~ Alex C~ <Media omitted>
12/26/15, 7:56 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha awesome
12/26/15, 7:56 PM ~ Sean B~ I'm boarding in Colorado for the next 4 days.  Flying back late on the 30th.  So I'm planning to drive up on the 31st with Rob
12/26/15, 8:17 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I'll be coming up on the 31st as well. Although, Sean, do you want to carpool? I think I might be in Somerville to check on the house.
12/26/15, 8:33 PM ~ Alex C~ Nice
12/26/15, 8:34 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah we can probably carpool
12/26/15, 8:35 PM ~ Sean B~ Alex let me know what i can bring
12/26/15, 8:56 PM ~ Alex C~ If all you guys could just bring a towel, pillow, and a sleeping bag. Most likely won't need the sleeping bag, but just in case.
12/26/15, 9:40 PM ~ Sean B~ Ok
12/26/15, 9:40 PM ~ Sean B~ What about food and drink
12/26/15, 10:03 PM ~ Alex C~ Don't worry about food or drink, we're gonna have a ton of stuff
12/26/15, 10:25 PM ~ Sean B~ Aight
12/27/15, 11:30 AM ~ Dave Wu~ The other day my cousin's kid got a new tablet and I was helping him set it up. The gmail stuff was easy, but then came the security part, Facebook, privacy and parental monitoring part. It then dawned on me just how woefully inept I'd be at raising a kid in the internet age. I have no idea how to keep a child safe from the horrors of the internet.
12/27/15, 4:14 PM ~ Alex C~ <Media omitted>
12/27/15, 6:42 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha
12/27/15, 6:43 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah it's pretty much impossible
12/28/15, 1:47 PM ~ james e mooradian~ <Media omitted>
12/28/15, 1:50 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol nice
12/28/15, 1:50 PM ~ Sean B~ Classic James puttin in extra hours

12/28/15, 1:52 PM ~ james e mooradian~ According to the schedule there will be less people here on Wed and Thurs
12/28/15, 1:54 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Looks like someone can work with no pants.
12/28/15, 1:56 PM ~ Sean B~ You coming to VT James?
12/28/15, 1:57 PM ~ james e mooradian~ As much as I'm a fan of hanging with my dick out, I think I'll avoid that while I'm out of the house
12/28/15, 1:57 PM ~ james e mooradian~ No, not gonna be able to come this year
12/28/15, 1:58 PM ~ james e mooradian~ My gramma's funeral is the 2nd so I'm gonna avoid being too far from Stamford this year
12/28/15, 1:58 PM ~ Sean B~ :(
12/28/15, 1:58 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I'll be more than happy to make the trip up any other time you guys have free
12/28/15, 1:58 PM ~ Sean B~ Sry bout your grandma bro
12/28/15, 1:59 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Thanks man. We all sort of saw it coming a way off but it was tough on the family all the same
12/28/15, 2:00 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Hope y'all have a good time up in VT though
12/28/15, 2:00 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Gonna miss searching the house for Dave at 10pm
12/28/15, 2:02 PM ~ Sean B~ We'll drink extra for you
12/28/15, 2:03 PM ~ Sean B~ Maybe we'll get one of those kiddie leashes for Dave and tether him to the house LOL
12/28/15, 2:13 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Hey man I never left the house I just needed a nap.
12/28/15, 2:13 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Jim, sorry to hear about your grandma.
12/28/15, 2:16 PM ~ Alex C~ Sorry to hear about your Grandma, Jim. We'll definitely have another trip up to VT in the new year. My parents also just recently bought a house on the beach in Madison, CT, so we'll all have to get together there one of these weekends
12/28/15, 2:21 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Thanks guys. And yeah any time you guys happen to be free would be cool with me. Madison is super close to where I live too

12/31/15, 11:55 AM ~ Dave Wu~ I'm leaving work at 6. Should be there a little before 9
12/31/15, 11:57 AM ~ Sean B~ I'm leaving Boston between 3 and 4

12/31/15, 4:41 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Have fun guise
12/31/15, 4:49 PM ~ Alex C~ When you guys get here, park up in the second driveway

1/1/16, 12:01 AM ~ james e mooradian~ <Media omitted>
1/3/16, 5:47 PM ~ Alex C~ What do you guys think of making a beer tasting app? It's basic function would be to let people join a 'tasting chat' like what we have here in WhatsApp, then the group would enter the names of beers as they try them and the group could rate each one as they drink. The app would tally the scores and keep track of everyone's tastes. There could even be a means of sharing 'playlists' of beer lineups for tastings. You could get other users to recommend good tasting lineups like 'great VT IPAs' for example. Or you could even get master Brewers to design playlists that highlight what they are trying to accomplish with their beers. There could also be a function that works like that community playlist app that Rob and Butze had at that party at Rob's house. Butze, would this be possible to program? We could get Rob involved too.
1/3/16, 7:28 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Sounds like a good idea. Linking it up with brewers and package stores would be key. Make it an avenue for promotion.
1/3/16, 8:17 PM ~ Sean B~ Sounds like a cool idea.  I'll talk to rob about it this week
1/3/16, 8:27 PM ~ Alex C~ Cool, sounds good. Dave, thinking more along the promotions line, imagine if you could walk into any of those huge beerfests and the app would give you and your friends possible tasting routes through the festival to travel so that you could strategically go about your tasting experience. All the while you can rate the beers in realtime with your group.
1/3/16, 11:01 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Alex, how did the fermentation bucket look. Any bubbling or warmth coming off the bucket? Maybe some bread smell.
1/3/16, 11:22 PM ~ Alex C~ Wasn't any bubbling so my dad took a quick peak under the lid. he said that despite the lack of bubbles it looks like something is happening.
1/4/16, 12:17 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Hmm. There might be some growth lag time before the yeast population explodes and they start putting up condos in the bucket.
1/4/16, 12:18 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Unfortunately there's no thermometer on the bucket. A temperature rise would mean activity.
1/4/16, 7:30 PM ~ Alex C~ We should have drilled another bunghole for checking temperature. A 'thermobung' haha
1/4/16, 7:37 PM ~ Dave Wu~ The 'you gonna get DP'ed any goddamn way' clip just played in my head'
1/4/16, 8:15 PM ~ Alex C~ Haha
1/5/16, 3:49 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I think my coworkers are struggling to grasp my 'you need to break some eggs to make an omelette' approach to healthcare. Sometimes there's outliers and you just gotta say fuck 'em. Don't got the resources to cater to every one.

1/6/16, 12:00 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Oo looks like some other people had Alex's idea too
1/6/16, 12:03 PM ~ Dave Wu~ It could always be emulated and bested with good marketing. Maybe force your way in by taking a key metro area, ie Boston.
1/7/16, 8:09 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
1/7/16, 8:14 PM ~ Alex C~ Dang that looks good! You made that!?
1/7/16, 8:15 PM ~ Alex C~ <Media omitted>
1/7/16, 8:16 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah I did!
1/7/16, 8:16 PM ~ Sean B~ It's awesome

1/8/16, 2:59 PM ~ Dave Wu~ “I’m going to die someday,” the man whispers.
1/8/16, 3:01 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha that was my favorite one
1/8/16, 3:09 PM ~ Dave Wu~ The piano key one was good too.
1/8/16, 3:10 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Remind me of this.
1/8/16, 3:11 PM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
1/8/16, 3:11 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha
1/8/16, 7:35 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Alex, how's the beer bucket looking?
1/8/16, 7:56 PM ~ Alex C~ Not sure, my parents have been in CT this week. Hopefully it's going well
1/11/16, 7:40 PM ~ Alex C~ Found a great intro book to mathematical logic for free online. Just google 'how to prove it pdf' and it'll come up
1/13/16, 12:02 AM ~ Sean B~ Nice
1/13/16, 7:48 AM ~ Dave Wu~ As I sit in traffic, I notice how absurd it is that each person lugs at least +3000 lb of empty car to and from work. There has to be a way to take advantage of all this wasted movement. Kinda like how red blood cells jostle around there circulatory network but act as carriers.
1/13/16, 11:13 AM ~ Sean B~ I'd guess people's desire for independence/autonomy is greater than their dislike of traffic or cost of driving.  Probably won't change until overpopulation reaches a critical point or fuel costs become prohibitive
1/13/16, 4:32 PM ~ Alex C~ Or if public transit becomes good enough so that people don't feel like they lose any autonomy by choosing it.
1/13/16, 4:33 PM ~ Alex C~ <Media omitted>
1/13/16, 8:33 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol
1/14/16, 12:09 PM ~ james e mooradian~ So I made a noob scripting mistake this morning
1/14/16, 12:10 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Wasn't paying attention to my code and accidentally made a looping recursive program that started up multiple copies of itself every loop
1/14/16, 12:10 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I tried manually closing it before I realized what was going on
1/14/16, 12:12 PM ~ james e mooradian~ There were a couple hundred programs running after a minute or two
1/14/16, 12:12 PM ~ Sean B~ HAHAHAHA
1/14/16, 12:13 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I was laughing way too much at my futile attempt, figured I'd share
1/14/16, 12:15 PM ~ Sean B~ Classic
1/14/16, 12:15 PM ~ Sean B~ https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_bomb
1/14/16, 12:17 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Hahahaha I literally fork bombed myself
1/14/16, 12:17 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I feel a little better knowing it has a name
1/14/16, 12:18 PM ~ Sean B~ Yep
1/14/16, 12:20 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
1/14/16, 12:23 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Got so much noob sauce on myself
1/14/16, 12:24 PM ~ james e mooradian~ And here I was thinking that my beard basically added the equivalent of an associates in cs
1/14/16, 4:07 PM ~ Sean B~ 'The Minivan':  two in the front, five in the back
1/14/16, 4:08 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Am I completely perverting this statement or does it really mean what I'm thinking.
1/14/16, 4:09 PM ~ Sean B~ Yes it does
1/14/16, 4:32 PM ~ Sean B~ Picked it up from amy schumer's new HBO special. It's pretty good
1/14/16, 6:54 PM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
1/14/16, 6:55 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol nice
1/14/16, 8:58 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I looked up the minivan on urban dictionary. I guess I over-perverted the definition. It involves hands. Not an insane gang bang scenario.
1/14/16, 8:59 PM ~ Sean B~ Oh really? I assumed the latter as well.  Still hilarious either way
1/14/16, 9:00 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Fucked up minds think alike
1/15/16, 2:58 PM ~ Alex C~ What's some good music to do math to? Already exhausted the Com Truise catalogue
1/15/16, 3:00 PM ~ Sean B~ Tycho
1/15/16, 3:00 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Yeah tycho
1/15/16, 3:00 PM ~ Sean B~ Also this https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/2ujjMpFriZ2nayLmrD1Jgl
1/15/16, 3:00 PM ~ Alex C~ Oh yeah, nice, I had forgot about Tycho, thanks! Thanks for the playlist too!
1/15/16, 3:01 PM ~ Dave Wu~ 2chainz
1/15/16, 3:01 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Or you could listen to nonstop trap if you wanna feel like you're driving the formula for slanging dope
1/15/16, 3:01 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Deriving*
1/15/16, 3:01 PM ~ Alex C~ Derive up to the club with my ceiling missing
1/15/16, 3:02 PM ~ Sean B~ The newest Helios album is also amazing.  Similar to Tycho

1/15/16, 3:03 PM ~ james e mooradian~ If you don't mind podcasts you might enjoy stuff you should know. I work to it a lot - it's light enough that you don't feel like you miss out on much by not paying attention
1/15/16, 3:04 PM ~ Alex C~ Sweet, bout to get mad rhombus up in here
1/15/16, 3:05 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Mathbonus is really good for working to too
1/15/16, 4:07 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Homeownership is like having a small child. So many things to pay for. I guess the object of life is to make a ton of money so you can just pay to fix the house and raise your kids.
1/15/16, 4:07 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Pay people*
1/17/16, 12:09 AM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
1/17/16, 12:18 AM ~ Sean B~ Haha
1/17/16, 8:20 AM ~ Dave Wu~ But seriously I just roughed it on a tarp. Would not recommend.
1/17/16, 9:31 AM ~ Sean B~ Jesus man you shoulda told me sooner I would have lent you the air mattress
1/17/16, 12:46 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I take it as penance. I may be stuffing some poor students in the basement.
1/17/16, 1:11 PM ~ Sean B~ Oh yeah?
1/17/16, 1:58 PM ~ Dave Wu~ My realtor found me two business students looking for accommodations on the cheap.
1/20/16, 4:03 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Alex, is the homebrew bucket healthy and fermenting?
1/20/16, 7:16 PM ~ Alex C~ Seems to be! My dad just started the secondary fermentation. Hopefully it comes out well. My uncle Pat's also for a batch going. He bought kettle and a fermenting tank after we did the Mutt's Nuts batch in VT
1/20/16, 8:36 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Oooo weee everyone's brewing
1/20/16, 8:39 PM ~ Alex C~ Yup, the two batches should be done around the same time too, so there's gonna be a lot of beer to drink
1/20/16, 10:18 PM ~ Sean B~ Oooo wee he's tryin!!
1/21/16, 12:04 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I'm looking at the various versions of turbotax and all I can think of is the making the band. 'You just gonna do your taxes right now. Is that hot? Is that what's going down in the streets?'
1/21/16, 12:17 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol
1/25/16, 3:55 PM ~ james e mooradian~ So I've been playing around with that face swap app
1/25/16, 3:55 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Decided to try it on that pic you guys sent for nye
1/25/16, 3:55 PM ~ james e mooradian~ <Media omitted>
1/25/16, 4:00 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Lol
1/25/16, 4:30 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahahaha
1/25/16, 6:51 PM ~ Sean B~ Scrolling through the 'people you may know' page on LinkedIn and laughing at how virtually all of the d-bag types I knew from high school are all 'business analysts' and 'account executives'
1/25/16, 6:53 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Isn't that like corporate entry level.
1/25/16, 6:54 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Or at least in pharma/pharma advertising
1/25/16, 6:55 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Yeah that's entry level biz
1/25/16, 6:56 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I don't think they have a position called 'fresh from business school' so they slap the word analyst on it
1/25/16, 6:56 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Fresh fruit cocktail for management
1/25/16, 6:56 PM ~ james e mooradian~ It's really weird in the finance industry too because that's what every single entry level person is called
1/25/16, 6:57 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Most of them don't do any analyses
1/25/16, 6:59 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Makes me think of that HRO Carles article about buying clothes on entry level wage
1/25/16, 6:59 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lol effing jcrew
1/25/16, 7:00 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah this one dudes job title is literally just 'analyst'
1/25/16, 7:01 PM ~ Sean B~ I think analyst is basically code word for 'I work at the business factory and make excel sheets all day'
1/25/16, 7:01 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Haha
1/25/16, 7:01 PM ~ james e mooradian~ It's just a title nowadays like associate or VP
1/25/16, 7:01 PM ~ Dave Wu~ After ten years everyone is avp
1/25/16, 7:02 PM ~ Sean B~ Account executive is corposeak for salesman
1/25/16, 7:02 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Your highschool acquaintances can come home every day and tell their loved ones that they did a business
1/25/16, 7:02 PM ~ Dave Wu~ A VP* not alien vs predator
1/25/16, 7:02 PM ~ Sean B~ speak*
1/25/16, 7:02 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Yeah
1/25/16, 7:03 PM ~ Sean B~ Went to the stock market and did a business again today
1/25/16, 7:04 PM ~ Sean B~ I've seen some tech companies use the title 'sales engineer' for sales people.  Like LOLwut
1/25/16, 7:05 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Those kinda buzzwords just make things so much worse
1/25/16, 7:05 PM ~ Sean B~ Just slap engineer on the end of your title and instantly make your job seem cool
1/25/16, 7:05 PM ~ Sean B~ Janitorial Services Engineer
1/25/16, 7:06 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Buttstuff engineer
1/25/16, 7:06 PM ~ Sean B~ Urnial Cake Replacement Engineer
1/25/16, 7:06 PM ~ Sean B~ urinal*
1/25/16, 7:06 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Just like those company 'about' pages that all day 'we use data integration and next level insights to produce business intelligence growth across a variety of verticals'
1/25/16, 7:07 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha yea
1/25/16, 7:07 PM ~ james e mooradian~ All say*
1/25/16, 7:08 PM ~ Sean B~ Last year a friend of mine came back from a career fair at school and was like 'Guys! You'll never believe it! All of the companies at the career fair today all do the same thing!'
1/25/16, 7:08 PM ~ Sean B~ We were like 'oh yeah what?'
1/25/16, 7:09 PM ~ Sean B~ 'B2b enterprise cloud solutions for the new millennium distilling insights from big data in the cloud!'
1/25/16, 7:09 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Oh god
1/25/16, 7:09 PM ~ Sean B~ It was so funny
1/25/16, 7:09 PM ~ Sean B~ And then we proceeded to look up random company websites and laugh at the About pages
1/25/16, 7:10 PM ~ Sean B~ Because they really do all sound like that
1/25/16, 7:10 PM ~ james e mooradian~ It's fucking horrendous actually applying for those jobs too
1/25/16, 7:10 PM ~ james e mooradian~ They're all exactly the same
1/25/16, 7:11 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I'm pretty sure I've applied for 30 or 40 places that all do data analytics SaaS that deliver BI insights
1/25/16, 7:11 PM ~ james e mooradian~ And apparently all of them have yahoo and Microsoft as a client
1/25/16, 7:13 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha yeah
1/25/16, 7:13 PM ~ Dave Wu~ That's why you need to start Mooradian Tech.
1/25/16, 7:14 PM ~ Dave Wu~ And fluff up the company description
1/25/16, 7:14 PM ~ Sean B~ It's pretty frustrating.  Feels like close to half of all tech companies basically just make some kind of analytics platform
1/25/16, 7:14 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I'm convinced that they do, honestly
1/25/16, 7:14 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Most of them seem like they're just more user friendly versions of SQL
1/25/16, 7:15 PM ~ Sean B~ Here's the play: leverage the trend and build a software framework for building analytics business insight platforms.  Like just study all of the common features and package them up.  'Instant analytics company, just add water and buzzwords'
1/25/16, 7:16 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Hahah
1/25/16, 7:16 PM ~ Sean B~ Like build a bear, but for genetic data companies
1/25/16, 7:16 PM ~ Sean B~ Generic*
1/25/16, 7:17 PM ~ james e mooradian~ If it weren't for a lot of companies having just the worst data management possible that would be super easy to do
1/25/16, 7:17 PM ~ james e mooradian~ But those SaaSes aren't for those people anywau
1/25/16, 7:18 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Just get something colorful and blocky
1/25/16, 7:18 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Like those donut peg games for toddlers but in app form
1/25/16, 7:19 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah
1/25/16, 7:20 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I feel like you could just tell those people about weka
1/25/16, 7:20 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Or just make weka look colorful and shit
1/25/16, 7:20 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha yeah
1/25/16, 7:20 PM ~ Sean B~ Not a bad idea.  Just build a pretty UI over weka.  Boom $100 million VC investment
1/25/16, 7:21 PM ~ Sean B~ Colorful charts and numbers fuck you you'll buy it
1/25/16, 7:21 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I think that's what some companies have already done with hadoop
1/25/16, 7:21 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Combine weka with shiny
1/25/16, 7:22 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I guess there's a need for it
1/25/16, 7:24 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah
1/26/16, 10:53 AM ~ Dave Wu~ What's that funky smell in the basement. Dead mice. #traphouseproblems
1/27/16, 9:40 AM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
1/27/16, 10:14 AM ~ Alex C~ Haha awesome, just heard his radio show on Monday. He kept playing this band called Soft Moon. Even did 3 songs of theirs in a row
1/27/16, 12:33 PM ~ Sean B~ Nice
1/30/16, 10:34 AM ~ Alex C~ Anyone know an efficient algorithm or ideally pre-written program for finding shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a network where the links between nodes are weighted?  They have something like that for traffic, Jim?
1/30/16, 10:35 AM ~ james e mooradian~ I usually use a premade algo built into the software i use
1/30/16, 10:36 AM ~ james e mooradian~ The greedy algorithm is pretty decent for a simple one
1/30/16, 10:36 AM ~ james e mooradian~ But I'm told there's a better algorithm to be used that you can probably find in an algorithms textbook
1/30/16, 10:36 AM ~ Alex C~ What's the software you use? Can it handle 1000's of nodes?
1/30/16, 10:36 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Oh yeah
1/30/16, 10:36 AM ~ james e mooradian~ CUBE voyager
1/30/16, 10:36 AM ~ james e mooradian~ I use
1/30/16, 10:37 AM ~ Alex C~ Nice, sweet name haha
1/30/16, 10:37 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Most of my networks are 5000 zones, maybe 60-100k nodes
1/30/16, 10:37 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Yeah lol
1/30/16, 10:37 AM ~ james e mooradian~ TransCAD is similar
1/30/16, 10:37 AM ~ james e mooradian~ If you have access to CUBE I can give you a bunch of scripts
1/30/16, 10:38 AM ~ james e mooradian~ It's not super common outside of industry asaik
1/30/16, 10:38 AM ~ james e mooradian~ AFAIK*
1/30/16, 10:39 AM ~ Alex C~ Cool, i'll look into those and see what UConn has licenses for. Thanks.
1/30/16, 10:40 AM ~ Sean B~ You need that Dijkstras algorithm brah
1/30/16, 10:40 AM ~ Sean B~ I think Python has a pretty robust graph library that can probably do it for you in like 2 lines of code
1/30/16, 10:45 AM ~ Alex C~ Yeah, I mostly worried about computation time. I will have relatively large spatial graphs and I want to couple the flow through multiple graphs, so I might need to solve them multiple times. Python's a good idea though. Probably has some parallel options
1/30/16, 10:46 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Yeah I mean python packages are hit and miss sometimes but I imagine a dijkstra package would work decently
1/30/16, 10:47 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Cython integration helps too
1/30/16, 10:47 AM ~ james e mooradian~ How is your network set up?
1/30/16, 10:47 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Youd likely have to reestablish it somehow depending on the program you use
1/30/16, 10:49 AM ~ Alex C~ I can represent it in any form I want. I have the fundamental data as ASCII files. Just found something called NetworkX for Python, which could be helpful
1/30/16, 10:51 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Might work decently for what you need. CUBE definitely does the job quickly (think probably 1-2 hour on a single core for 3000-5000 zones to load the path at equilibrium and maybe a minute or two to find a single iteration set of shortest paths) but you might not have access to it
1/30/16, 10:52 AM ~ james e mooradian~ If you're not doing equilibrium network loading I wouldn't worry too much about computation time
1/30/16, 10:52 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Unless the algo is poorly optimized i wouldn't imagine more than 10 minutes for single iteration on one core
1/30/16, 10:55 AM ~ Sean B~ https://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/reference/algorithms.shortest_paths.html
1/30/16, 10:56 AM ~ Alex C~ Cool, ok, I'm going to try some options out and see what I have access too. Thanks for the infos.
1/30/16, 12:09 PM ~ Alex C~ <Media omitted>
1/30/16, 12:10 PM ~ Alex C~ I think just 2 more weeks until drinking
1/30/16, 12:10 PM ~ Sean B~ Ooo wee
1/30/16, 12:11 PM ~ Alex C~ You guys wanna do a trip up to VT in a couple weeks when they're done?
1/30/16, 12:25 PM ~ Sean B~ Ohh yeah that'd be awesome
1/30/16, 12:25 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Aw snap macaroni party
1/30/16, 12:25 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Oo damn
1/30/16, 12:25 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Yeah I'd definitely be in for that
1/30/16, 12:26 PM ~ james e mooradian~ As long as its not valentines day weekend I'm good to go
1/30/16, 12:26 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Plus, I miss you guys. It's been like 4-5 months now
1/30/16, 12:27 PM ~ Sean B~ Ya we miss u james
1/30/16, 12:27 PM ~ Sean B~ bb <3
1/30/16, 12:27 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lmao
1/30/16, 1:25 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I'm free in February except the 20th. So id be down to come up to vt
1/30/16, 3:23 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Might be a good time to roast a turkey again too
1/30/16, 7:03 PM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
1/30/16, 7:10 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol
1/30/16, 7:10 PM ~ Sean B~ One on the right looks like some kind of sexual thing
1/30/16, 7:10 PM ~ james e mooradian~ <Media omitted>
1/30/16, 7:10 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Found this today at amity
1/30/16, 7:10 PM ~ james e mooradian~ It's made by the same guys who make the vacuum beers
1/30/16, 7:10 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha nice
2/1/16, 6:01 PM ~ Sean B~ So what weekend would work for everyone?
2/1/16, 6:02 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I'm free the weekend of the 27-28th
2/1/16, 6:03 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Unless I need to show a unit to renters
2/1/16, 6:13 PM ~ Sean B~ I think that would work for me as well
2/1/16, 6:25 PM ~ james e mooradian~ That one works for me too
2/1/16, 8:53 PM ~ Alex C~ Sheeuuutt, I have to go to Long Island that weekend to do experiments. Would the weekend after work?
2/1/16, 9:45 PM ~ Sean B~ Not for me 😞
2/3/16, 8:53 AM ~ Sean B~ I suppose I could sit this one out if we can't make something work.  Don't wanna deprive everyone of homemade beer
2/3/16, 10:07 AM ~ Alex C~ We can always do it the week after that. It's not like it goes bad in a couple weeks
2/3/16, 12:04 PM ~ Sean B~ Alright yeah I might be able to do the week after
2/4/16, 11:15 AM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
2/4/16, 11:15 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Complete opposite of the standing desk
2/4/16, 11:18 AM ~ Alex C~ Looks like some kind of high tech station for j'in it
2/4/16, 11:19 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Just thought I'd bear grylls 'lay back and think of the mother land.....ughhh'
2/4/16, 11:20 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Of*
2/4/16, 11:20 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Just load up a separate video on each screen and really treat yourself
2/4/16, 11:21 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Although the design looks like you'd have to spend like 4 full minutes getting in and out of that thing
2/4/16, 11:22 AM ~ Alex C~ Install a toilet hole in that recliner and baboom problem solved
2/4/16, 11:23 AM ~ Dave Wu~ That incline might also the golden angle of optimal bowel evacuation.
2/4/16, 11:24 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Be*
2/4/16, 11:30 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Desk is probably best for a masturbatorium.
2/4/16, 11:33 AM ~ Alex C~ Nothing. But. Net.
2/4/16, 11:34 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Haha gross
2/4/16, 11:36 AM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
2/4/16, 11:36 AM ~ Alex C~ Hahahaha
2/4/16, 12:06 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahahaha this convo = gold
2/4/16, 6:46 PM ~ Sean B~ So I can almost definitely do the weekend of March 11, if that jives with the rest of y'all
2/4/16, 8:21 PM ~ Alex C~ Works for me
2/5/16, 4:14 PM ~ Alex C~ I think I just had one of the nerdiest thoughts of my life. Was doing some math for this model I'm making and I thought to myself: 'Ah Math, the Sam to my Frodo. At times, I resent him, but in the end, I'll be glad he's always there.' Combo math and fantasy literature nerddom.
2/5/16, 4:16 PM ~ Sean B~ Damn you really haven't touched a woman in a while huh
2/5/16, 4:16 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol
2/5/16, 4:16 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Haha. Sam and Frodo were quite the special buddies.
2/5/16, 4:47 PM ~ Alex C~ Hahaha
2/5/16, 5:12 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lol maths. Your companion on the journey of life
2/5/16, 5:12 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I guess in this analogy mount doom is hell but you get the idea
2/5/16, 8:41 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>

2/5/16, 8:44 PM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
2/5/16, 8:45 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Those are some nice ass loafs
2/5/16, 8:45 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Sneaky Baker?
2/5/16, 8:45 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha yep
2/5/16, 8:46 PM ~ Dave Wu~ You should start making dark pump loafs.
2/5/16, 8:47 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha yeah I should
2/5/16, 8:48 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Bread of choice for the Hot Carl sandwich
2/6/16, 12:23 PM ~ Dave Wu~ And today we have to call a priest to let him know his estrogen is denied....should be a good conversation.
2/6/16, 3:59 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol
2/6/16, 9:31 PM ~ Sean B~ You guys seen this Donald Trump lebowski mashup? So good https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=h6oxvm9Q68Q
2/7/16, 12:45 PM ~ Alex C~ Haha that is pretty great.
2/7/16, 2:59 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Lol nice
2/7/16, 6:40 PM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
2/8/16, 9:08 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Here’s a song for you… The Ballad Of Martyn Bootyspoon by Sinjin Hawke
https://open.spotify.com/track/6hndEqujogYYHn6BW5eguX
2/8/16, 9:09 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Not sure I've shared this before but this is a hilarious transition track on the sinjin hawke album.
2/9/16, 10:01 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol nice
2/11/16, 2:26 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Job listing 'Benefits: Great benefit package'
2/11/16, 2:27 PM ~ Dave Wu~ This comes from an ad agency listing too.  Sounds like dental is optional.
2/11/16, 2:56 PM ~ james e mooradian~ It's an employer's market man. Most places could offer euthenasia as the only provided healthcare benefit and people would still apply.
2/11/16, 3:04 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
2/11/16, 3:04 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
2/11/16, 3:05 PM ~ Sean B~ It's upsetting how poorly we treat workers in this country
2/11/16, 3:07 PM ~ Dave Wu~ 'Murica
2/11/16, 3:07 PM ~ james e mooradian~ We're pretty fucking terrible. To be fair, its expected vs mandatory (like I think in Japan it's expected that you work 60-80 hour weeks regardless) but still
2/11/16, 3:07 PM ~ james e mooradian~ We're pretty great at fucking over the common man
2/11/16, 3:08 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah the Japanese are workaholics too.  But vast majority of developed nations are so much better.  It's embarrassing
2/11/16, 3:09 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Yeah
2/11/16, 3:10 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I mean I know Spain is doing pretty poorly at the moment, but it sounds pretty idyllic there based on things I hear from George and manuella
2/11/16, 3:11 PM ~ james e mooradian~ People working maybe 20-30 hours a week, having week-long holidays, and just generally chilling so hard
2/11/16, 3:12 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah.  European culture is great.
2/11/16, 3:15 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Well at least our work culture is still better than Asia.
2/11/16, 3:15 PM ~ Sean B~ Just gotta marry a European chick.  Get that dual citizenship.  Ahbooyah
2/12/16, 5:43 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Had to deny an infirmed priest's medication. The facility took a while to pull the guy out of bed and into a wheel chair just to receive my call. All the while i was left on hold with choir/Gregorian chant music. Unfortunately the priest was no longer coherent, so i hastily said my bit about denials and ended the call. A most awkward experience to say the least.
2/12/16, 5:48 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Jesus
2/12/16, 5:48 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I gotta say man
2/12/16, 5:49 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Reading those insurance texts feel a lot like watching seasons 2-5 of breaking bad
2/12/16, 6:11 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Haven't seen breaking bad yet so Im not sure how the show plays out. Wasn't it all about meth, Miami and money.
2/12/16, 8:05 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I mean Walt gets pretty badass for a good while
2/12/16, 8:06 PM ~ james e mooradian~ So I'm heading down to the city for everyone's favorite holiday
2/12/16, 8:06 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Forgot to take into account the fact that florists close at 6-7pm on fridays
2/12/16, 8:30 PM ~ Sean B~ Nice one bro
2/12/16, 8:30 PM ~ Sean B~ Just sneak out in the AM while she's still asleep
2/12/16, 8:38 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Just bring Mr Poopybutthole.
2/12/16, 8:38 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I think the plant has flowering potential.
2/12/16, 8:44 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lol Mr poopybutthole is a true treasure
2/12/16, 9:07 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
2/12/16, 9:07 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
2/13/16, 9:36 AM ~ Dave Wu~ And that piece will be added to the existential decor in my cube.
2/13/16, 12:18 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I could see it
2/13/16, 12:19 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Like one of those exhibits where you wear headphones and you just hear random snippets of 'Kelly Byrne'
2/13/16, 12:19 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Just barely audible
2/13/16, 1:07 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha yeah
2/13/16, 2:14 PM ~ Sean B~ Aw nice was just bought to head to whole foods and grab a bouquet too
2/13/16, 2:15 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Not too shabby
2/13/16, 2:16 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Definitely make sure they havent been sitting for a week or two. Otherwise they're great
2/14/16, 2:05 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Sign I'm getting old: starting to really enjoy going to the home depot.
2/14/16, 3:02 PM ~ Sean B~ Got a nice little Sunday planned out?
2/15/16, 1:15 PM ~ Dave Wu~ At work I'm known for making sure cases are airtight and hands are clean for decisions. Apparently, the method has been holding up stuff for members/patients.
2/15/16, 1:15 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I guess I'm this guy:   http://i.bittwiddlers.org/KHt.gif
2/15/16, 4:25 PM ~ Alex C~ Hahaha
2/15/16, 6:18 PM ~ Sean B~ That's cold
2/15/16, 6:22 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Nah I'm not deliberately delaying approvals. Just making sure nothing can get flipped on me in an audit and as much liability as possible gets thrown on the prescriber.
2/15/16, 6:23 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Healthcare is a rough place gotta keep a tight butthole.

2/16/16, 12:55 PM ~ Alex C~ Damn, that looks good!
2/16/16, 12:56 PM ~ Alex C~ I'm going to be in Boston visiting Kelly this weekend. Dave and Sean, will you guys be around?
2/16/16, 1:06 PM ~ Sean B~ Thanks!
2/16/16, 1:06 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah I think I'll be around.  We should hang
2/16/16, 1:11 PM ~ Dave Wu~ That's a fine looking loaf you got that. Should open a bakery. Lots of nice retail spaces vacating in East Somerville and hurting for some young gentrifiers to bring 'hip' to the neighborhood.
2/16/16, 1:12 PM ~ Dave Wu~ There*
2/16/16, 1:12 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Unfortunately I won't be in cousin this weekend. Carpet store stuff and dates.
2/16/16, 1:12 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Boston*
2/16/16, 3:49 PM ~ Alex C~ Alright, cool, I'll link up with you, Butze, via text once I know exactly when I'll be up there.
2/16/16, 3:56 PM ~ Sean B~ Cool
2/18/16, 11:24 AM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
2/18/16, 2:19 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Haha life

2/18/16, 10:08 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
2/18/16, 10:09 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Hahaha that really is the perfect response
2/20/16, 8:54 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Had a dream last night and all of you were in it. Alex had his graduation party at Chuckie Cheese. Fun times.
2/20/16, 9:19 AM ~ Sean B~ Hahahaha amazing.  Can we do that for real?
2/20/16, 9:39 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Lmao that sounds pretty great
2/20/16, 9:40 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Tying one on reeeal tight at our good buddy Chuck E.'s place
2/20/16, 9:53 AM ~ Dave Wu~ An entire afternoon at Blips and Chitz!!!!!
2/20/16, 10:03 AM ~ Alex C~ Hahaha we could take over the ball pit
2/22/16, 3:07 PM ~ Dave Wu~ When i see the the security question: what is your all time favorite pastime?  I want to answer: Marathon wanking in the masturbatorium. Probably make a good conversation starter when a customer rep needs to confirm my identity.
2/24/16, 9:35 PM ~ Alex C~ It'd be especially hilarious if they ask you to spell that please haha
2/24/16, 9:36 PM ~ Alex C~ You guys remember this classic bear grylls clip? https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=L6ytCxm62fk
2/24/16, 9:58 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha
2/24/16, 9:58 PM ~ Sean B~ 'Sorry, sorry'
2/25/16, 9:49 AM ~ Sean B~ Another terrifying demo from Boston dynamics https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rVlhMGQgDkY
2/25/16, 10:16 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Awesome. I'm not a Luddite, so I'm OK with the whole robots and AI replacing humanity thing.
2/25/16, 10:18 AM ~ Dave Wu~ And when the robot was knocked down I thought about keyboard kid 'g g g get up mom.'
2/25/16, 10:27 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Lol so great
2/25/16, 10:28 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Some guy on imgur wrote wrote captions to narrate the video, really makes it hit home
2/25/16, 10:28 AM ~ james e mooradian~ http://m.imgur.com/gallery/XxL7G
2/25/16, 11:03 AM ~ Dave Wu~ #robotlivesmatter
2/25/16, 3:08 PM ~ Sean B~ Oh my god
2/25/16, 3:08 PM ~ Sean B~ So funny
2/25/16, 5:31 PM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
2/26/16, 4:42 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Hey so, serious question
2/26/16, 4:42 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Is 'one and done' innuendo
2/26/16, 4:43 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Matter of context.
2/26/16, 4:43 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I wrote a report on modeling approaches and I've labelled my preferred approach the 'one and done technique'
2/26/16, 4:43 PM ~ Dave Wu~ But it's pretty benign and commonly used
2/26/16, 4:44 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Should be alright. Not like the model is named rail and bail
2/26/16, 4:44 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Sorta sounds like I'm advocating for premature ejaculation all over TDMs
2/26/16, 4:44 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lmao
2/26/16, 4:44 PM ~ james e mooradian~ But maybe
2/26/16, 4:45 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Oh yeah there's the the prejac definition too.
2/26/16, 4:45 PM ~ james e mooradian~ It's a double innuendo
2/26/16, 4:45 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I guess
2/26/16, 4:45 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Maybe I'm advocating promiscuity and quickies
2/26/16, 4:46 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Is that what the transportation engineering industry is all about?
2/26/16, 4:46 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Mostly, yeah
2/26/16, 4:47 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Living life in the fast lane
2/26/16, 4:47 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Best way to make money in the industry
2/26/16, 4:47 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Or hov lane
2/26/16, 4:47 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Express land dude
2/26/16, 4:47 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Or managed lane if you're in some states
2/26/16, 4:48 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Clearly it just means I need to rename my other approach to the 'clown on that model technique'
2/26/16, 4:49 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Please name a model dog washing and have it published in a renown textbook.
2/26/16, 4:52 PM ~ james e mooradian~ That's the dream
2/26/16, 5:05 PM ~ Alex C~ Then in subsequent textbooks written by other authors, there'd be chapters called Mooradian's Dog Washing Model
2/26/16, 5:07 PM ~ Alex C~ There'd be engineers who would have difficult traffic problems and others would consult them saying things like, 'have you tried dog washing, I.e., Mooradian's method?'
2/26/16, 5:11 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I would love to see those citations
2/26/16, 5:12 PM ~ james e mooradian~ 'Queue accumulation for toll assignent models was first refined via dog washing (Mooradian, 20always)
2/26/16, 5:13 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Would really make me appreciate my accomplishments in life
2/26/16, 5:20 PM ~ Dave Wu~ You'll be on the cover of Time. James Mooradian eliminates all traffic by dog washing.
2/26/16, 9:13 PM ~ Sean B~ LOL
2/26/16, 9:13 PM ~ Sean B~ I don't think one and done has sexual connotation, for what it's worth
2/26/16, 9:14 PM ~ Alex C~ Pump and dump does though. Just in case you were considering that as an alternative
2/26/16, 9:35 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha
2/26/16, 9:35 PM ~ Sean B~ Rail and bail
2/26/16, 9:35 PM ~ Sean B~ Hit it and quit it's
2/26/16, 9:35 PM ~ Sean B~ it*
2/26/16, 9:44 PM ~ Sean B~ The 'wham-bam-thankyou-Pam' model of queue accumulation (Mooradian et al, 2016)
2/26/16, 9:58 PM ~ Alex C~ The 'nutnutnutnutnut nutsack in da asshole'
2/27/16, 9:17 AM ~ Sean B~ Built upon the previously discovered method of 'flipping the dick down'
2/27/16, 5:36 PM ~ Sean B~ Are we on for VT in two weeks?
2/27/16, 5:48 PM ~ Alex C~ I'm in. On the 12th, right?
2/27/16, 5:57 PM ~ Sean B~ Cool.  Yeah
2/28/16, 11:11 AM ~ Sean B~ Dave and Jim?
2/28/16, 11:58 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Yeah still in for sure
2/28/16, 11:58 AM ~ Dave Wu~ I think I can, depends on the house
2/28/16, 12:42 PM ~ Sean B~ Sweet
2/29/16, 1:51 PM ~ Dave Wu~ So I'm planting hops rhizomes in the spring. Should have a shit load of hops mid summer. Anybody want to play around with some next level brewing?
2/29/16, 1:52 PM ~ Sean B~ Damn nice
2/29/16, 5:57 PM ~ Sean B~ I prob won't be around during the summer though
2/29/16, 6:20 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Oh are you moving out of the Boston area?
2/29/16, 6:22 PM ~ Sean B~ Not sure yet but either way I'm going to South America during the summer.
3/2/16, 8:10 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Should I bring my turkey up to vt next week. If so I'll start the defrosting process.
3/2/16, 8:18 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
3/2/16, 9:32 PM ~ Sean B~ I'm probably gonna make bread.  Taking requests.  Was thinking of doing homemade Dark Pump
3/2/16, 10:03 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Aw shit the Sneaky Baker bringing loafs
3/2/16, 10:33 PM ~ Sean B~ You know it
3/2/16, 11:00 PM ~ Alex C~ Definitely bring the turkey. Bout to be a straight up feast.
3/2/16, 11:44 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Guess I'll do a little research, see if there are more next-level ways to cook a turkey
3/3/16, 2:33 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Left a generic hipaa privacy compliant message on an answering machine. Patient's wife calls back asking what was approved. Per privacy regs we can't say which med, but they can asked if a med is approved. She asks about her husband's cialis. We tell her yes it's approved. She's extremely happy. That's my job. I restore the dick supply in old couple's marriages.
3/3/16, 2:34 PM ~ Sean B~ Ahbooyah
3/3/16, 3:17 PM ~ Alex C~ Touching lives one dick at a time
3/3/16, 5:28 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Haha gross
3/4/16, 1:47 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I think I'm the only person in the office that's totally amped that my denial case is going before a judge. First in company history.
3/5/16, 12:51 AM ~ james e mooradian~ <Media omitted>
3/5/16, 9:19 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Got excited for a second. Thought Jim was dropping another office track
3/5/16, 11:04 AM ~ Sean B~ The return of Cindy Byrne
3/8/16, 2:07 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Uh oh. Just learned I can't have a beard and wear a standard respirator mask. Either gotta shave or drop a good amount of money on a Vader mask.
3/8/16, 2:49 PM ~ Alex C~ Why do you need to wear a respirator mask?
3/8/16, 3:05 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Need to remove some tile work. Lots of fine particulate, likely lead paint.
3/8/16, 4:26 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Yeah but think of all the sweet urban exploration you could do with a Darth Vader respirator
3/9/16, 5:36 PM ~ Dave Wu~ You know how you can get collagen to puff up lips. Now you can get injections right in the butt hole too. Got a loose butthole? No problem. A couple back door injections and you'll be holding back the chocolate river like that Dutch kid with his thumb. Must be a godsend for extreme anal open porn stars in their retirement years.
3/9/16, 5:37 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Yeah I had to deny the butthole med today after doing extensive research.
3/9/16, 6:10 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol
3/9/16, 6:11 PM ~ Sean B~ Their tag line should be 'Ass so tight it won't even let the nuts out yeaaaa'
3/9/16, 6:15 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Thumbs up from Tony Eveready
3/9/16, 8:52 PM ~ Alex C~ Hahaha loled at the Dutch boy reference
3/9/16, 8:52 PM ~ Alex C~ You guys ready to get weird this weekend?
3/9/16, 8:52 PM ~ Sean B~ Sheeeeiit you know it
3/9/16, 8:54 PM ~ Alex C~ When are you all going to arrive? I'm going up tomorrow morning and am going to work from up there for tomorrow afternoon and Friday
3/9/16, 8:55 PM ~ Sean B~ Rob and I are gonna try to leave Boston around 330 on Friday
3/9/16, 8:55 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I got with until 5 Friday so ETA 8-830
3/9/16, 8:55 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Work*
3/9/16, 8:56 PM ~ Alex C~ Nice
3/9/16, 8:57 PM ~ Sean B~ Planning to bring up dough to make bread with.  What else do we need?
3/9/16, 8:58 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Sounds like I'll be last to the party, got that 530ish departure
3/9/16, 8:59 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I can grab a few supplemental beers for us
3/9/16, 9:00 PM ~ Alex C~ Sweet, my mom also made chili and some chicken salad. What we typically lack during these weekends is fruits and veggies. Although, I think my mom usually has a box of lettuce and spinach handy.
3/9/16, 9:01 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I was gonna say I can grab some plants to bring up
3/9/16, 9:01 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Though I think it might just be easiest to grab some veggies at the shaws
3/9/16, 9:01 PM ~ Alex C~ Yeah, that's probably true
3/9/16, 9:02 PM ~ Alex C~ Looks like it'll be good weather this weekend. Could potentially do a hike or at least play some cornhole in the backyard
3/9/16, 9:04 PM ~ Sean B~ I'm down to hike.  Been a while
3/9/16, 9:07 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I need to hike. Gotta do it so I don't feel like I'm full of shit when talk to dates.
3/9/16, 9:07 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I*
3/9/16, 9:08 PM ~ Alex C~ Haha great, we can see if the snow is melted enough. Should be good though
3/9/16, 9:45 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Is the kayaking place open?
3/9/16, 10:16 PM ~ Alex C~ Might be a little cold for kayaking.
3/11/16, 1:44 PM ~ Alex C~ Butze, your car had 4wd, right? It's mud season here and the road's a little dicey at the moment. My CRV makes it fine, but you have to be a little careful. Dave, let us know when you get to downtown Ludlow and we've arranged for you to be able to park your car at our neighbor's closer to where the road is still paved. Jimmy is your car 4wd? If not, you can also park at our neighbor's. Just let us know when you're close.
3/11/16, 1:47 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Ah OK. I could still give the road a shot. As long as there's no ice/snow. The tires are pretty decent for wet traction in moderately warm weather.
3/11/16, 1:49 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Unless the road becoming a +6inch deep chocolate river?
3/11/16, 1:55 PM ~ Sean B~ Ok. Yeah I got dat 4wd
3/11/16, 1:56 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I'll have to park on pavement most likely - my car is kinda iffy in mud and snow
3/11/16, 1:56 PM ~ james e mooradian~ None of that 4wd
3/11/16, 3:24 PM ~ Alex C~ Yeah, I'm not sure how bad it is now, but during the rain yesterday, it was approaching 6in deep chocolate River. Dave and Jim, just let us know when you're close and we'll meet you at a place to park. Butze, you should be good to go.
3/11/16, 3:39 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Side note: '6 inch deep chocolate river' probably could be a scat porn title.
3/11/16, 4:01 PM ~ Sean B~ Cool
3/11/16, 4:04 PM ~ Sean B~ Leaving Boston now
3/11/16, 4:07 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Alex, what would the easiest way to contact you be
3/11/16, 4:07 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Not sure how cell access, etc is near ludlow
3/11/16, 4:08 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Also at your house
3/11/16, 4:34 PM ~ Alex C~ The landline at the house is 802 975 0586. The cell service in downtown ludlow should be fine. Let us know when you're to the stoplight in town and we'll head down the hill to our neighbor's as you head up
3/11/16, 5:13 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Power dumped, hitting the road now
3/11/16, 5:15 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Awesome, thanks alex
3/11/16, 5:15 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I'll let you know when i get on the road, should be about 30-45 mins from now
3/11/16, 6:16 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Alright, heading out now. I'll see you guys in a few hrs
3/11/16, 6:17 PM ~ Alex C~ Cool, see you guys in a little bit
3/11/16, 8:08 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Where should I park?
3/11/16, 8:18 PM ~ Alex C~ Jimmy, Dave's car made it up the hill. It's up to you if you want to try, but it's not problem to drop your car off at out friend's down the hill. Let me know
3/12/16, 3:13 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Alex, me Sean and Dave ran out to Shaw's to grab the rest of the food
3/12/16, 3:13 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Well be back in 15-20
3/12/16, 3:14 PM ~ Alex C~ Ok cool

3/13/16, 7:26 PM ~ Sean B~ Nice.  Yeah they have a few different books
3/13/16, 9:47 PM ~ Alex C~ Awesome, thanks!
3/14/16, 12:19 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Today I learned that after paying 26k in taxes, I don't have a $75 tax return but actual owe another 10k. The government just flipped the dick down on my wallet.
3/14/16, 1:24 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Minecraft to run artificial intelligence experiments - http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35778288
3/14/16, 1:44 PM ~ Alex C~ So soon there'll be a AI agent with a nerdy voice giving a YouTube tour of his minecraft world? Can't wait
3/14/16, 1:56 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Honestly though that's really neat
3/14/16, 1:57 PM ~ james e mooradian~ If that stuff was around when I was like 10-12 years old, I'd be all over that shit
3/14/16, 1:57 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Even now I might give it a go
3/15/16, 6:04 PM ~ Alex C~ The pumpernickel bread recipe calls for 'cornstarch wash' and cites a sidebar on pg 51. Could you snap a photo of that and send it?
3/15/16, 6:43 PM ~ Dave Wu~ That's the part when you dump the ball of dough into the trash and remember that as time stretches out all human projects will dissolve and fail. The striving towards the pumpernickel bread must, in the end, be enough.
3/15/16, 7:18 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol perfecr
3/15/16, 7:18 PM ~ Sean B~ perfect*

3/17/16, 10:51 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Nice loafs
3/17/16, 10:51 AM ~ Dave Wu~ And this https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-fallible-mind/201601/why-ted-cruz-s-facial-expression-makes-me-uneasy
3/17/16, 11:14 AM ~ Sean B~ Wow nice! Looks tasty
3/17/16, 11:14 AM ~ Sean B~ Where'd you get the seeds?
3/17/16, 11:25 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Hope my gluten free loafs come out that nice tomorrow.
3/17/16, 11:40 AM ~ Alex C~ I got the caraway seeds at price chopper. They were with all of the spices. Good luck with the gluten free loaves, Wu! You doing those for a date, right? Even if they come out badly, it should still be fun. It's the 'striving that must suffice' haha
3/17/16, 12:29 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Yep some hands on bread making activities for a date. Artisan bread and chill.
3/17/16, 1:37 PM ~ Sean B~ The loaves look a lot lighter than I would expect.  Did you omit any ingredients?
3/17/16, 1:45 PM ~ Alex C~ The only thing I did differently from the recipe was I made my own caramel color. That's probably why. Instead of as a powder, I had it as a liquid, so maybe I should have used more to get it darker.
3/17/16, 1:46 PM ~ Sean B~ Ah ok
3/17/16, 1:46 PM ~ Alex C~ This is the caramel color recipe that I used

3/18/16, 10:44 PM ~ Sean B~ No sir
3/19/16, 8:52 AM ~ Dave Wu~ So I guess I'm going to this girl's med school formal. Good thing I didn't follow through with the dates with the other girls in her program.
3/19/16, 8:55 AM ~ Sean B~ Lol

3/20/16, 11:35 PM ~ Sean B~ Yes Tennessee
3/20/16, 11:35 PM ~ Alex C~ Nice, was probably some good eatin there I bet
3/20/16, 11:36 PM ~ Alex C~ You on a job interview? Just some vacation?
3/21/16, 12:03 AM ~ Sean B~ Visiting my brother and his family
3/21/16, 3:47 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah Memphis bbq is da bomb
3/21/16, 4:34 PM ~ Alex C~ The south really does have some redeeming qualities after all
3/21/16, 5:05 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Keyword: 'Some'
3/21/16, 5:40 PM ~ Sean B~ Might be its only redeeming quality
3/21/16, 5:53 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Although isn't the Memphis real estate market hot shit right now?
3/21/16, 5:54 PM ~ Sean B~ Just for rent cash flow according to my bro.  Super cheap property but no value appreciation
3/21/16, 10:14 PM ~ Alex C~ <Media omitted>
3/21/16, 11:37 PM ~ Sean B~ Sheeeeut
3/22/16, 2:07 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Damn that bread looks pretty legit
3/22/16, 2:21 PM ~ Alex C~ Thanks. As it turns out, it was slightly underbaked in the middle. Still dialing it in. Also, you guys might find this amusing. I'm parallelizing my Matlab for that network problem I'm working on and it basically involves switching the command 'for' to 'parfor'. Pretty far from the metal.
3/23/16, 6:47 PM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>

3/24/16, 5:50 PM ~ Sean B~ Didn't use caramel color, but increased the amounts of cocoa, molasses and coffee to darken the color.  Worked decently well
3/24/16, 5:57 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Oh shit that double dark pump
3/24/16, 6:22 PM ~ james e mooradian~ So apparently there was an attempt at conversational AI by Microsoft
3/24/16, 6:23 PM ~ james e mooradian~ http://www.socialhax.com/2016/03/24/microsoft-creates-ai-bot-internet-immediately-turns-racist/
3/24/16, 6:23 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Went about as well as one would assume
3/24/16, 6:30 PM ~ Sean B~ lol that's amazing
3/24/16, 8:46 PM ~ Alex C~ Haha amazing and simultaneously horrifying 

that's some real nice dark pump, Butze! Great loaf shaping. How long did you cook/cool those? I keep getting slightly under-cooked centers. Also the freeze and toast trick works great
3/24/16, 9:00 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I need to find a gluten free version of the dark pump.
3/24/16, 9:08 PM ~ Sean B~ Thanks! A couple things:  If the dough has already been refrigerated you generally need to increase the pre-bake resting time by about 1.5x to 2x.  Also you may just need to bake it longer.  I've yet to over-cook a loaf.  I use a kitchen scale to weigh the dough beforehand to know how big the portion is.  The book's bake times assume a certain weight.  The time has to be increased if the loaf is heavier.
3/24/16, 9:30 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
3/24/16, 9:41 PM ~ Alex C~ Thanks!

3/25/16, 11:55 AM ~ Dave Wu~ So I have an email specifically for house related things: correspondences with tenants, contractors, and bank stuff. Based on the ads for 50+ dating sites, I think Google has lumped me in to the middle age demographic.
3/25/16, 11:56 AM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
3/25/16, 11:57 AM ~ Sean B~ WOW
3/25/16, 11:57 AM ~ Dave Wu~ The post-we kept it together for the kids demographic
3/25/16, 11:57 AM ~ Sean B~ Is that real life?
3/25/16, 11:57 AM ~ Sean B~ That's so fucking sad
3/25/16, 12:04 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Yeah I'm not sure what's worse. Making divorce as easy as ordering pizza with phone sticks from grubhub or the fact that marketers have determined that divorce services are in demand among the middle age demographic.
3/26/16, 4:37 PM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
3/26/16, 5:31 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha nice
3/27/16, 9:10 PM ~ Alex C~ Just started Twin Peaks. Love the dialogue. The FBI guy is great
3/27/16, 10:53 PM ~ Sean B~ Nice.  Yeah Kyle McLaughlin really makes the entire show IMO

3/28/16, 7:37 PM ~ Sean B~ Jesus
3/31/16, 4:12 PM ~ Alex C~ Jim, this shortest paths problem I've been working on has brought me to a big data problem. I now have the algorithm so that it can do the calculation graphs with 3-4 thousand nodes and 4-5 thousand edges. The whole calculation takes about 1 min. If I move up to 10 thousand nodes, however, the matrices no longer fit into my computer's physical memory and it freezes. I need to allocate and call memory more efficiently. Any keywords I should look into for solutions? Butze, you have any experience with this?
3/31/16, 4:14 PM ~ james e mooradian~ My first thought would be to change the matrix value type, if it's possible to to in MATLAB and you can afford the potential loss of accuracy
3/31/16, 4:14 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Are you working with doubles now?
3/31/16, 4:14 PM ~ james e mooradian~ If you are able to modify to some sort of integer value or a long it would probably be the most straightforward way to use less memory
3/31/16, 4:16 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Maybe also write out partial matrices
3/31/16, 4:16 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I wouldn't be sure what to do without looking at the setup in more detail but maybe Sean has better ideas for memory management
3/31/16, 4:23 PM ~ james e mooradian~ This might help with my first suggestion http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/numeric-types.html?s_tid=gn_loc_drop
3/31/16, 4:23 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Depends on how much memory you need to cut
3/31/16, 4:25 PM ~ james e mooradian~ It's not scalable - still a limit to the number of links and nodes you can use with that approach - but if you're confident you won't have >>10k you are probably safe with a type change
3/31/16, 4:27 PM ~ Alex C~ That's a good idea as a relatively simple first hack at it. I think I can definitely drop some precision.
3/31/16, 4:29 PM ~ Alex C~ Thank you
3/31/16, 4:31 PM ~ james e mooradian~ NP, good luck with that network
3/31/16, 5:11 PM ~ Dave Wu~ And I just walked into this conversation like a child that wanders into the middle of a movie.
4/1/16, 10:56 AM ~ Sean B~ Sorry my whatsapp seemed to have been turned off for the past few days.  I'm not sure off the top of my head but guaranteed there is a solution.  Potentially something even built in to the python library if that's what you're using.  There are all kinds of disk-caching techniques that can get around the memory limit problem, I'm sure there must be something available for graph libraries
4/1/16, 11:02 AM ~ Sean B~ 10 thousand nodes is not a big number though for a graph, so I'm not sure exactly where the memory problem is coming from.  What data are you storing in each node?
4/1/16, 11:09 AM ~ Alex C~ Yeah, my WhatsApp does the same thing whenever it updates. It stops giving notifications of messages. I'm definitely going to try Jim's idea of more carefully assigning my data types. Yeah, the problem is that I ultimately need to calculate an N x N matrix where N is the number of nodes whose values depend on 3 other N x N matrices. Each entry i,j of each matrix gives me a certain property of the shortest path from i,j if there is one. I'm doing all of the calculations locally in parallel (the iterations of a for loop are evaluated competitively by the parallel workers) and in order to do that Matlab replicates all of the matrices for each of the workers. When that happens the physical memory gets used up really quickly. Matlab had some documentation for this problem that offers a bunch of potential solutions. I was seeing if you or Jim may have known of one off hand to help me down select from the list.
4/1/16, 11:11 AM ~ Sean B~ What are the values in each matrix?  Also is this a known algorithm or something you came up Erin?
4/1/16, 11:11 AM ~ Sean B~ came up with*
4/1/16, 11:56 AM ~ Alex C~ The values in each matrix are currently 64bit floating point numbers. The algorithm for shortest paths is built in to Matlab and returns a shortest path tree. The part I came up with is basically a depth first search algorithm where the entire tree is traversed and properties of each edge are summed and stored along the way to get all of the shortest path's properties.
4/1/16, 11:59 AM ~ Sean B~ Hmm ok yeah so that's gonna yield 800MB per matrix. And if there's 4 total then 3.2GB.  Doable but if the parallel workers are all making duplicate copies then that's definitely gonna be a problem
4/1/16, 12:00 PM ~ Sean B~ Im assuming the 64 bit numbers are distances or edge weights of some sort?
4/1/16, 12:01 PM ~ Alex C~ Yeah, geometric properties of the edges
4/1/16, 12:02 PM ~ Alex C~ Right now I'm working on making them all 32bit
4/1/16, 12:03 PM ~ Alex C~ Then I might mess around with distributing the matrices or creating what Matlab called a 'data store' or using a function they have called 'mapreduce'
4/1/16, 12:04 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah the mapreduce approach is typically applied to these kinds of problems I think
4/1/16, 12:06 PM ~ Sean B~ The real dominating factor is the NxN.  When you have sparse graphs you can use a different representation to use less space but not sure that's applicable to your situation
4/1/16, 12:08 PM ~ Alex C~ Yeah, I already have them represented as sparse. Currently there are a lot of infinities in the entries. Maybe I can convert those to 0's as I go. Luckily the values range from 1 to infinity so I can unambiguously reassign zero to any infinities
4/1/16, 12:09 PM ~ Sean B~ Well technically 0 and infinity occupy the same amount of bits, unless the implementation doesn't allocate any memory for 0 values.  Hard to say without knowing what's under the hood
4/1/16, 12:11 PM ~ Alex C~ In Matlab they have a function called sparse that 'squeezes all of the 0's out of a sparse matrix to save space'.
4/1/16, 12:11 PM ~ Sean B~ Oh cool
4/1/16, 12:26 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Dumb question but is your MATLAB distribution 64 bit? No idea how old your machine is but I'd think a research computer would come with at least 8gb memory
4/1/16, 12:27 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I feel like just having that squared away would eliminate any need to change your script if it's the difference between 3.2 GB and the 2 GB limit of a 32 bit program
4/1/16, 12:28 PM ~ Alex C~ Yeah, my Matlab is 64 bit. I'm actually running on a super high performance computer with 12 CPUs and 24GB of RAM.
4/1/16, 12:29 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Okay so 12*3.2 kinda bones you
4/1/16, 12:30 PM ~ Alex C~ Yup
4/1/16, 12:30 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Do you specify the number of nodes in the mapreduce statement?
4/1/16, 12:30 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I would probably try running it on like 4 cores first
4/1/16, 12:31 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Youd have a rough idea of how much memory you're trying to assign if it works/fails
4/1/16, 12:32 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Because 32 bit vs 64 bit probably won't help if 4*memoryUse still runs into memory issues
4/1/16, 12:33 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah.  Biggest win would come from reducing duplication of the matrices and somehow allowing workers to handle only subsets of the matrices, which is the kind of thing mapreduce tends to do
4/1/16, 12:37 PM ~ Sean B~ Would definitely look into the datastore library.  Looks like the kind of thing I've seen in the past to handle super big arrays.  Basically you can store the matrix on disk and read a subset of rows/columns into memory, rather than having to read the entire thing
4/1/16, 12:40 PM ~ Alex C~ Those are all very good ideas. I'm going to try them out. Thanks!
4/1/16, 2:31 PM ~ Alex C~ <Media omitted>

4/1/16, 4:22 PM ~ Alex C~ Hahaha
4/1/16, 5:11 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Yep turning down my other acceptances was definitely the most financially sound decision I've made.
4/1/16, 5:12 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Aww shit nice
4/1/16, 5:12 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Hope our backseat coding works out for you
4/1/16, 5:12 PM ~ james e mooradian~ But yeah also totally had the exact same conversation this afternoon
4/1/16, 5:12 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lack of crippling student loan debt is so hot right now
4/1/16, 5:14 PM ~ Sean B~ Glad we made the long-term play

4/1/16, 5:55 PM ~ james e mooradian~ If you pull it off I may have to share with the missus
4/1/16, 5:56 PM ~ Alex C~ Awesome, please do share that recipe when you've got it dialed in. As I was reading through the ingredients the thought 'nothing but net' passed through my mind.
4/1/16, 5:57 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha yeah it's most definitely high fiber.  Plus dat Omega-3 hotness via the flax seed
4/1/16, 5:59 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I could really use some of that right now

4/1/16, 6:01 PM ~ Sean B~ That's looks real good though
4/1/16, 6:33 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lmao yeah
4/1/16, 6:33 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Prince's hot chicken
4/1/16, 6:33 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Apparently the best dish in the city but
4/1/16, 6:34 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Yeah hot lava poo for the whole next dsy
4/1/16, 6:45 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol
4/1/16, 6:45 PM ~ Sean B~ Backboard shattering

4/1/16, 6:55 PM ~ Alex C~ Hahaha
4/2/16, 11:34 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Tonight I went to the med school formal with the girl I'm dating. I learned that my feelings for this girl are indistinguishable from my feelings for the house I bought. I'm too cold and dead on the inside to bring myself to care about the girls I meet. But I wear a solid good mask.
4/3/16, 12:27 AM ~ Alex C~ Have you been seeing this girl long? I'm definitely no expert, but it can take some time to start to care for somebody just like it takes some time to feel at home in a new house.
4/3/16, 10:58 AM ~ Sean B~ Agree with Alex, it can take time.  But I am more worried about your own mental health.  Feeling 'dead inside' is not normal and very unhealthy.  You should feel free to talk to us any time but also try to get professional help as well.  I have periodically struggled with similar feelings over the past few years and only recently finally decided I am going to do something about it and get help.  It's not a good way to live.
4/3/16, 9:17 PM ~ Alex C~ Well said, Sean. I've also gotten help in the past. I think there's a reason why our group identifies with comics like 'depression parkour'. I don't mean to imply that any of our experiences can be equated exactly. Each person's experience is unique. How's your mindset now, Dave?
4/4/16, 1:02 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Thanks for the support. Things have just been really stressful lately, which pulls me to a point where I just avoid emotions. That combined with social anxiety at the formal and being confused by the how carefree her peers seemed basically put me over the edge.
4/4/16, 1:13 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I'm feeling a bit better now. Although, I'm pretty sure I've been making a poor effort at showing her any affection. And I was particularly detached/sullen Saturday night. We haven't talked since and I'm guessing she's disappointed.
4/4/16, 1:40 PM ~ Sean B~ I can definitely understand.  I've found that social isolation can be a particular hard thing to deal with and overcome.  Especially because it can be self-perpetuating, as in it causes you to feel bad but that in turn can make other people seem even more foreign because it seems like they are living in a different world and can't really understand, which causes you to feel worse, etc.  It's very difficult.
4/4/16, 1:43 PM ~ Sean B~ When it comes to romantic relationships I believe in keeping communication as open as possible.  If you really like this girl and want to make it work I would suggest just being honest with her about what you're going through and how you feel.  It may be difficult for her but it's almost always better to have honest communication than for her to feel like she's in the dark and has no idea what's wrong.  She might be wrongly blaming herself or drawing incorrect conclusions.  You may even find that you feel closer to her after laying it all out on the table.  Maybe not.  But it has worked for me in the past.
4/4/16, 2:41 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I''ve been thinking about going the honesty route. Although, I just got a splits text. So, I don't know.
4/4/16, 2:41 PM ~ Sean B~ Splits text?
4/4/16, 2:55 PM ~ Dave Wu~ The 'too busy for a relationship, etc.' Though I know it's because of my emotional unavailability.
4/4/16, 3:49 PM ~ Dave Wu~ When you spend over two decades learning to remove emotions and building around learning disorders, this is what happens. Works for my job, but completely detrimental for my social life.
4/4/16, 4:20 PM ~ Sean B~ Damn sorry dude that's too bad.  If it were me I would still probably apologize and offer some explanation, just out of courtesy even if it's not going to salvage the relationship.
4/4/16, 4:24 PM ~ Alex C~ Butze's probably right. Nothing to lose doing that. Dave, you should give yourself some more credit for just going to the formal in the first place. That type of stuff can be so overwhelming and exhausting. How do people actually enjoy those things? It's a difficult date night, especially if you just started seeing someone. I definitely would have felt extremely uncomfortable. So definitely give yourself some credit for stepping out of your comfort zone and going at all. Takes some cajones just to be present for something like that, in my opinion at least.
4/4/16, 5:49 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah I agree, I hadn't even considered that aspect.  I probably would have been uncomfortable as well. It's definitely not an easy thing to do
4/5/16, 10:03 AM ~ james e mooradian~ I hope it's not too late to say that I'll be there if any of you guys need me as well. This kind of group text is probably not my preferred venue for sharing, but I'd be happy to talk.
4/5/16, 10:05 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Also, totally in agreement. Those formal-type events suck multiple bags of balls. Helps a bit if you and the other attendees are drinking heavily.
4/5/16, 10:07 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Even then, not the easiest to get through
4/5/16, 11:34 PM ~ Alex C~ <Media omitted>
4/5/16, 11:36 PM ~ Alex C~ Just to lighten the mood for a moment. Also, WhatsApp just notified me with that message that they now have 'end to end encryption', which kinda sounds like a butthole reference.
4/6/16, 10:08 AM ~ james e mooradian~ That's actually really awesome of WhatsApp to do
4/6/16, 10:08 AM - Messages you send to this group are now secured with end-to-end encryption. Tap for more info.
4/6/16, 10:16 AM ~ Sean B~ Yeah I think all the messaging apps are doing it as a result of the FBI vs Apple fiasco
4/6/16, 10:17 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Not to change the subject too many times but Sean, are you still in touch with your old boss at growth spark?
4/6/16, 10:18 AM ~ Sean B~ Yeah I am
4/6/16, 10:19 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Longish story but I'm thinking about starting something with a PM of mine
4/6/16, 10:19 AM ~ james e mooradian~ I'm still in the stage of seeing if it's even doable
4/6/16, 10:20 AM ~ james e mooradian~ But it would be cool to talk to someone who's running a company now to get an idea of management/overhead and stuff like that
4/6/16, 10:27 AM ~ Dave Wu~ As we change topics, just want to say thanks y'all for being supportive. I'm think I've put this whole fiasco behind me and it's probably best that it's over. Lotta lessons learned and things to fix.
4/6/16, 10:32 AM ~ Sean B~ Absolutely Dave.  Dating is hard and trying to find someone you're compatible with takes a lot of work and learning, but I know you will find a great girl one of these days.  It's 100% worth it in the end
4/6/16, 10:32 AM ~ Sean B~ Jim I can definitely put you in touch with Ross, he loves to talk to people.  Just send me your email and I can do an introduction
4/6/16, 10:44 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Thanks Sean, that would be great. I still have a ton of research to do on my own but hopefully I can get an idea of how smart/stupid it would be
4/6/16, 10:45 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Email is james.e.mooradian@gmail.com
4/7/16, 11:18 AM ~ Dave Wu~ End to end encryption just makes me think of ass tah ass from requiem for a dream.
4/7/16, 4:09 PM ~ Sean B~ This new article just came out in the times about emotion and masculinity.  I think it's really good and an important topic.  Basically a serious/scientific version of Bill Burr's 'what are you a faaaagg?' joke. Glad to see this making its way into public discourse because I think it's a huge problem and almost no one talks about it. http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/education/edlife/teaching-men-to-be-emotionally-honest.html?smprod=nytcore-ipad&smid=nytcore-ipad-share&_r=0
4/8/16, 11:35 AM ~ Alex C~ That's a really great article. It's amazing how much of the discussion overlaps with Bill Burr's comedy. I feel like he has bits that hit on all of the nuances that were mentioned in the article. Also made me think of this great song called ugly cherries I just heard by this band of two drag queens called PWR BTTM. The singer said he wrote it about his struggle to fully accept his being queer and his desire to express himself through drag culture, but if you listen to the lyrics in the context of that article, they pretty much hit dead on how it feels to not be able to express an important part of your being, whatever it is. Kind of like Billy Budd. You guys have to read that in high school? The singer also said that he was thinking of that adage that if you say you're alright enough you'll be alright and whether it could actually be true. So there's a great part where he basically is shouting he's alright in a tone that sounds strained and doubtful. Also there's a face melting guitar lick in the song. Thought-provoking stuff http://youtu.be/KX_tBWLmr1s
4/8/16, 2:10 PM ~ Sean B~ Nice.  Yeah I can definitely see the connection.  Clever band name too

4/10/16, 11:08 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Wonder if some nasty motherfuckers can cultivate some human cheese and really round out the meal
4/10/16, 3:18 PM ~ Alex C~ Butze, how long did it take for the wild yeast to colonize that stuff?
4/10/16, 3:44 PM ~ Sean B~ Took about 4-5 days to get a fully active culture going.  But once you get that you can store it in the fridge and feed it just once per week to keep it alive
4/10/16, 3:45 PM ~ Alex C~ Wow, pretty cool
4/10/16, 3:45 PM ~ Sean B~ It took around 10 hours for the dough to rise
4/10/16, 3:46 PM ~ Sean B~ And you gotta fold it periodically during that time.  Definitely at least a full day commitment.  But it sure is cool as hell
4/10/16, 9:59 PM ~ Sean B~ Lookin like RobAndSean-a-Palooza is gonna be on April 30th.  Can you guys make it?
4/11/16, 10:34 AM ~ Dave Wu~ I'll be there late. Got work until 6 that day.
4/11/16, 10:44 AM ~ Alex C~ I'll be able to make it too
4/11/16, 10:52 AM ~ james e mooradian~ I probably can make it. I have to be in Virginia that week for work but I should be back by Friday night
4/11/16, 11:25 AM ~ Sean B~ Alright cool!

4/15/16, 10:18 PM ~ Alex C~ Ahh that's right
4/15/16, 10:34 PM ~ james e mooradian~ If it's any consolation, the pitchers and jugs are fucking enormous
4/15/16, 10:35 PM ~ james e mooradian~ It's like 10 and 20 drinks
4/16/16, 8:21 AM ~ Sean B~ I feel hungover just thinking about that

4/22/16, 5:54 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Took another look at Dave's pic. Did not notice the names before but I gotta say I'm a huge fan of whoever decided to label them
4/22/16, 5:55 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Are they names of the strain of hops or are they like little names for each plant
4/22/16, 5:55 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Either way, it's pretty great
4/22/16, 6:00 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Oh yeah those are strains. Though it would be hilarious if I gave all of them names like Mr poopybutthole.
4/22/16, 6:14 PM ~ Sean B~ That 'dro
4/22/16, 6:23 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lol if you ever crossbreed the hops you totally should

4/24/16, 10:23 AM ~ Dave Wu~ All these fancy names for paint colors. Maybe I should get into the paint name game. Autoerotic Asphyxiation Blue and Bukakke White sound like paints you'd wanna slather on your walls, right?
4/24/16, 11:03 AM ~ Sean B~ Lol
4/26/16, 6:02 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Just found a water supply pipe embedded within layers of floor I just had removed. Not gonna be one bit surprised if a dead body or two drops out the ceiling.
4/26/16, 6:21 PM ~ Sean B~ Or some stacks of cash if you're lucky
4/26/16, 6:32 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Most likely stacks of dead mice.
4/27/16, 12:12 PM ~ Sean B~ Will I be seeing all of your beautiful faces this weekend?

4/27/16, 2:28 PM ~ Sean B~ Sweeeet
4/27/16, 2:31 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I'll be there as well
4/27/16, 2:33 PM ~ Sean B~ Nice!
4/27/16, 6:48 PM ~ Sean B~ My place is available if any of y'all need a place to stay
4/27/16, 6:56 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Cool, cool
4/27/16, 6:57 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I was looking into hotels just in case but I haven't booked anything yet
4/27/16, 7:01 PM ~ Sean B~ Nah don't do that.  We can make it work.  Unless you really prefer to
4/27/16, 7:24 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Plus there's also my place. The rentable unit is in good. Unless you want full authentic trap basement experience.
4/27/16, 7:25 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lmao only if I can load up an all future playlist to sleep to
4/27/16, 7:38 PM ~ Sean B~ Whatever y'all wanna do
4/27/16, 7:39 PM ~ Sean B~ Also was thinking it would be nice to do some kind of activity together other than the party if there's time.  Maybe on Sunday
4/27/16, 7:41 PM ~ james e mooradian~ What time should we get there btw?
4/27/16, 7:47 PM ~ Sean B~ Umm good question.  Party officially starts at 8.  But I should be around if you want to come up earlier and bro down
4/27/16, 8:15 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I think I should be free Sunday. Just gotta buy paint at the home depot and load my car with reno waste.
4/27/16, 8:16 PM ~ Alex C~ I should be free to come up earlier and stay for a little while on Sunday. I'm going to stay at my sister's. Normally, my sister's condo would be a good option as a place for all of us non-Bostonian to stay, but this time Kelly has a couple friends visiting for the weekend, so with them and me the pullouts will be full.
4/27/16, 8:26 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Saturday I'm working so I'll probably arrive just in time rocking some business casual.
4/27/16, 8:29 PM ~ Sean B~ Ok cool.  Well Jim you can plan to stay with me then, or at Daves
4/27/16, 8:31 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Although Sean can I crash at your place? I'll be on the tarp game again.
4/27/16, 8:32 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Well with a sleeping bag.
4/27/16, 8:32 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah definitely.  One can take the couch and the other can have the air mattress
4/27/16, 8:45 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Here’s an artist I want to share with you… Hazy Mountains 
https://open.spotify.com/artist/6jsYILCzyqcMt3ZDq4P9GS
4/27/16, 9:16 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I'll plan on staying at your place Sean. I can definitely come early too
4/27/16, 9:20 PM ~ Sean B~ Ok cool!
4/28/16, 12:05 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Sean, I'll probably be arriving a little before 8 on Saturday. Should come to your place and drop my stuff off or head straight to the party?
4/28/16, 1:35 PM ~ Sean B~ Probably better to drop your stuff first so you don't have to drive after.  I could leave a key for you to get in. Do you have a Somerville parking pass now?
4/28/16, 1:39 PM ~ Dave Wu~ OK. I only have a visitor pass for my area. Car still registered in CT. Although it's Saturday at 8 so I should be able to street park at your place overnight. They don't check parking on Sundays.
4/28/16, 1:44 PM ~ Sean B~ Ok.  Yeah as long as they aren't dicks and ticket you before midnight.  I think Courtney already used my pass twice this week so I don't think it can be used again til next week
4/28/16, 1:46 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I guess I could drop off my stuff off at your place, then park at Otis, uber over to the party.
4/28/16, 1:47 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah that could also work
4/28/16, 2:31 PM ~ Dave Wu~ BTW y'all should let Hazy Mountains slide into your ears and tickle your brain balls.
4/28/16, 2:42 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha I'll check it out.  Love gettin my brain balls tickled
4/28/16, 3:19 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Just got this month's Somerville newsletter. Green energy, volunteer planting in green spaces, bike days, and plastic bag ban proposal...... Shit this place just went full retard.
4/28/16, 3:20 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha
4/28/16, 3:21 PM ~ Sean B~ The Cambridge center for adult education is offering a class in urban beekeeping.  Might have to get in on that.  Take the personal brand to a whole new dimension
4/29/16, 8:37 AM ~ Alex C~ <Media omitted>
4/29/16, 9:01 AM ~ Sean B~ Hahahaha awesome.  Yeah I think that was when you were in Germany
4/29/16, 10:09 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Just accidentally wiped my phone. What did i miss here?
4/29/16, 10:11 AM ~ Sean B~ Were you listening to the Dude's story? Were you listening to the Dude's story?
4/29/16, 10:12 AM ~ Dave Wu~ happy birthday, Sean
4/29/16, 10:30 AM ~ Sean B~ Haha thanks
4/29/16, 11:07 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Dang I lost all those sweet pics from our last vt trip.
4/29/16, 2:55 PM ~ Alex C~ Sean and Jim, Kelly and some of her friends are planning on going to the Arnold Arboretum tomorrow from around 1130am to 4pm. I was probably going to meet them there on my way into the city if you guys wanted to come too.
4/29/16, 3:09 PM ~ Sean B~ Cool.  I'm not sure if I can go, might have to run some errands during the day
4/29/16, 3:15 PM ~ Alex C~ Ok, cool, figured I'd float it out there just in case
4/29/16, 3:15 PM ~ Sean B~ Thanks though
4/29/16, 3:35 PM ~ Alex C~ Dave, I listened to a couple songs from that band you recommended. Very chill. I've only listened to a little bit but it's like a chill-skype-wave fusion
4/29/16, 5:10 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah this sounds cool
4/29/16, 5:11 PM ~ Dave Wu~ The newer tracks have the modern age 80s sound mixed with chill waves. Saxophone
4/29/16, 5:17 PM ~ Alex C~ Nice, also I've meant to tell you guys that satellite radio recently broadcasted a live com truise concert. Dude's really hitting the big time
4/29/16, 5:20 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Gonna be seeing the truise live again in New haven may 12.
4/29/16, 5:37 PM ~ Sean B~ Aw sheeut
4/29/16, 5:37 PM ~ Sean B~ Wish he would come back to Boston

5/2/16, 7:39 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Just learned some people are planning to leave the office in 2 months. Shit is guaranteed to fall apart. I think my office just reached the same level of bad as Jim's office.
5/2/16, 7:39 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Bad news bears when I'm pulling a mortgage.
5/2/16, 7:50 PM ~ Sean B~ Sheeut

5/3/16, 10:39 AM ~ Alex C~ Hahaha love when he just shouts the names of his friends
5/3/16, 3:13 PM ~ Sean B~ Also when he calls out the other guy for going to 'the poor school'

5/5/16, 1:00 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Could totally up our turkey game
5/5/16, 1:00 PM ~ james e mooradian~ That's pretty outrageous dude
5/5/16, 1:02 PM ~ Sean B~ With a setup like that we can up our everything game
5/5/16, 1:03 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Might as well make an entire meal from base ingredients
5/5/16, 1:03 PM ~ Dave Wu~ like an apple pie from scratch?
5/5/16, 1:03 PM ~ Alex C~ Going to be some epic meals
5/5/16, 1:03 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Prettymuch yeah
5/5/16, 1:03 PM ~ Dave Wu~ or create the universe
5/5/16, 1:04 PM ~ Alex C~ Hahaha just got the reference

5/5/16, 2:14 PM ~ Alex C~ That shaping tho
5/5/16, 2:21 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I still think we should start an artisan bread/urban garden for the homeless type charity.
5/5/16, 2:22 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah I've been trying to get better at shaping.  Been following this guy on Instagram who's a total pro: https://instagram.com/p/BEj92hNBGwO/
5/5/16, 2:22 PM ~ Sean B~ That could be a good idea
5/5/16, 2:22 PM ~ Dave Wu~ help the homeless and build a personal brand that makes the local baguettes moist.... win win
5/5/16, 2:25 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Also i like the word 'moist.' There just something about its connotations and pronunciation. Or it's the coffee and sudafed playing drums in my head.
5/5/16, 2:38 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha
5/5/16, 3:51 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Dat swirl.. Holy crap

5/9/16, 12:02 PM ~ james e mooradian~ That's pretty amazing
5/9/16, 12:02 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Xanga was the shit back in freshman year of highschool
5/9/16, 12:03 PM ~ Sean B~ I know.  It's like a time capsule
5/9/16, 12:03 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Nice way to look back and cringe real hard
5/9/16, 12:03 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
5/9/16, 12:04 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Obviously
5/9/16, 12:04 PM ~ Sean B~ All thanks to the archive.org wayback machine
5/9/16, 12:04 PM ~ james e mooradian~ It definitely paints a picture
5/9/16, 12:14 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Wow. I still have a MySpace page sitting around from back in the day. I'll think I have the security settings at 11. Probably get rid of it when if I run for public office.
5/9/16, 12:15 PM ~ Sean B~ Pics!!!
5/9/16, 12:16 PM ~ Dave Wu~ And speaking of old stuff. We all graduated high school 10 years ago. Let that sink in for a moment.
5/9/16, 12:19 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I wonder what 17 year old me thought he'd himself doing in 10 years. Probably some do good, hope filled shit.
5/9/16, 12:27 PM ~ Sean B~ Astronaut
5/9/16, 2:12 PM ~ Dave Wu~ 27 year old Dave still wants to be an astronaut and chill with HAL 9000.

5/10/16, 5:44 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I foresee some 'on our wedding night she reached back and peeled off her face' situations
5/11/16, 10:22 AM ~ Sean B~ Damn yeah that could get real creepy
5/11/16, 12:57 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Oh shit I was just listening to them talk about that on NPR
5/11/16, 1:47 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Imagine no injections. Just a quick spray and you got balls as smooth as eggs.
5/11/16, 1:50 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Hoowee
5/11/16, 1:50 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Sorta reminds me of that futurama episode where everybody gets 300 bucks and the professor slathers a bunch of stem cells on his face
5/11/16, 4:21 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
5/11/16, 4:28 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Haha. It's the James for me as well.

5/11/16, 4:44 PM ~ Dave Wu~ it'd make a sweet t shirt
5/11/16, 4:45 PM ~ Dave Wu~ or start a gym franchise called James.
5/11/16, 4:47 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol
5/11/16, 5:17 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I could be the on site personal trainer
5/11/16, 5:18 PM ~ Sean B~ 'Hi I'm James, welcome to the James, now let's get you hella James'd up'

5/13/16, 10:10 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Everybody knows you don't use smoked fish in sushi
5/13/16, 10:10 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Guy clearly belongs under that table
5/13/16, 10:21 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Yeah that sushi was goofed the moment he picked up the smoked salmon package at the store. Metaphor for the guy's life being messed up from the moment of his conception.
5/13/16, 10:34 AM ~ Sean B~ Lol you guys are cold
5/13/16, 10:34 AM ~ Sean B~ Poor guy
5/13/16, 3:17 PM ~ Sean B~ FYI, I'm co-hosting a party for my graduation in Somerville on Sunday May 22nd.  I know it's a long way for y'all and you were just here for my birthday so I don't expect you to come, but if you want to you are obviously welcome and I'd be stoked to have any of you in attendance
5/13/16, 3:21 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Can the Pope's dick fit through a donut?
5/13/16, 3:48 PM ~ Alex C~ Unfortunately, I'm going to be in San Francisco that weekend for experiments otherwise I would definitely be in attendance
5/13/16, 3:49 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I should be able to come that weekend. Aru is gonna be away doing her pre-new job travelling and I don't have anything going on in my life
5/13/16, 3:50 PM ~ Sean B~ No prob Alex
5/13/16, 3:53 PM ~ Sean B~ Cool so Dave and Jim I'll hopefully have you both attending which would be rad
5/13/16, 4:02 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Is there any particular dress code, like jncos and korn t shirts only?
5/13/16, 4:03 PM ~ Sean B~ Jncos mandatory. Linkin park or staind shirts also acceptable
5/13/16, 4:04 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Shit I hope I can find my matching vans
5/13/16, 4:05 PM ~ Sean B~ Dress code: 'nu metal chic'
5/13/16, 4:06 PM ~ Sean B~ Dress code: '1999 hot topic / x-games fan'
5/13/16, 4:31 PM ~ Alex C~ Speaking of that, SNL parodied nu metal last week, pretty funny https://youtu.be/QO0J8VEO6u8

5/14/16, 9:19 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Just went to a bakery for breakfast. Sean, I think I caught a glimpse of your future

5/14/16, 1:17 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Artsan cheeses and jam
5/14/16, 1:17 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Just smacking me in the face with its sweaty hipster balls
5/14/16, 1:17 PM ~ Sean B~ Wow yeah haha
5/14/16, 1:19 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Didn't notice at first but those two guys in the front of the pic also have climbing gear
5/14/16, 1:34 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha nice
5/14/16, 5:09 PM ~ Dave Wu~ BTW what does that AF 100 emoticon thing mean?
5/14/16, 5:29 PM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
5/14/16, 6:00 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Goddamn look at that sweet vinyl flooring
5/14/16, 6:00 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Same flooring that was in aru's first apartment in manhattan
5/14/16, 6:01 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I wish it was vinyl. The hardwood boxes are just heavy and unweidly.
5/14/16, 6:02 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Oh damn so it's real deal
5/14/16, 6:04 PM ~ Sean B~ Dat piff
5/14/16, 6:05 PM ~ james e mooradian~ You can put that shit right on the apartment listing
5/14/16, 6:05 PM ~ james e mooradian~ 1br apartment. All hardwood floors - none of that snicklefritz
5/14/16, 6:07 PM ~ Sean B~ To the best of my knowledge... Af = 'as fuck', as in 'cool as fuck.'  Goals is used as an adjective instead of a noun.  'This shit is goals as fuck'. 100 emoji I believe is just for emphasis.  Like 'times 100' or '100%'
5/14/16, 6:07 PM ~ Sean B~ Just what the young whippersnappers be saying these days. Trying to stay relevant
5/14/16, 6:08 PM ~ Dave Wu~ ah now I understand those young girls' tinder profiles
5/14/16, 6:08 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Yeah the hardwood should help with the listing.
5/14/16, 6:09 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Also, never knew there were so many baguettes that shop at home depot Somerville.
5/14/16, 6:12 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Maybe I should be a plumber up here snake some drains and flush some pipes
5/14/16, 6:13 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol
5/16/16, 12:16 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Saw a rotund white girl in yoga pants jogging in East Somerville. She's like the physical manifestation of my dreams for this area. Keep jogging East Somerville, get that figure slim and gentrified.
5/16/16, 12:17 PM ~ Sean B~ lol
5/16/16, 12:17 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lol
5/16/16, 12:18 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Neighborhood's gonna start popping off before you know it

5/17/16, 6:08 PM ~ james e mooradian~ His head legit looks like a lego man

5/27/16, 12:06 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Y'all up to anything for memorial weekend? Got served some Pillsbury flaky pastries so I'm up to a whole lotta nothing.

5/27/16, 3:15 PM ~ Alex C~ I'm out in San Diego for a conference this weekend
5/27/16, 4:11 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Well I guess I'll be solo baking loafs.
5/27/16, 4:14 PM ~ Dave Wu~ not a euphemism... literally lonely bread baking.
5/27/16, 5:25 PM ~ Sean B~ Dude solo baking loaves is a great time
5/27/16, 5:25 PM ~ Sean B~ Nothing but you and the dough
5/27/16, 5:45 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I might be able to do something tomorrow Dave. Gotta do some EDA/report writing but Id be up for something in the afternoon if you wanna hang out
5/27/16, 5:46 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I'm not sure about sun/Mon just yet. Aru is supposed to be back in NYC tomorrow afternoon/evening but idk if she will be up for doing anything what with a 12 hour time difference
5/27/16, 7:16 PM ~ Dave Wu~ yeah I'd be down to do something in the afternoon like a New Haven adventure.
5/27/16, 7:17 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I'm in
5/27/16, 7:17 PM ~ james e mooradian~ It's nice as hell out
5/27/16, 7:17 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Worst case scenario we could grab some za and drinks at bar
5/27/16, 7:18 PM ~ james e mooradian~ They usually open giant garage door thing up so it's basically outdoor seating
5/27/16, 9:34 PM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
5/27/16, 9:36 PM ~ Dave Wu~ and Jim bar sounds like a good idea as long as it's not backroom hidden dance club bar
5/27/16, 9:48 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lool nah George isn't here so we can go ahead and avoid that
5/27/16, 11:14 PM ~ Sean B~ Ooh nice loaf what kind is it?
5/27/16, 11:38 PM ~ Dave Wu~ that 5 minute quick loaf
5/27/16, 11:42 PM ~ Dave Wu~ pinchin' loafs would make a good bakery name. Or maybe Valsalva's
5/28/16, 7:40 AM ~ Sean B~ Nice.  White bread?
5/28/16, 9:42 AM ~ Dave Wu~ White bread for now. Slowly easing my way back into bread making. Crust came out nice. Shame I messed up the amount of salt.
5/31/16, 9:39 AM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
5/31/16, 9:39 AM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
5/31/16, 9:41 AM ~ Sean B~ There was also a guy playing a banjo, and two girls dancing with LED-light up hula hoops
5/31/16, 9:48 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Looks like it could've been a indie music video like the one from foals.
5/31/16, 9:58 AM ~ Sean B~ Haha yeah I thought of that.  Just like the Olympic airways video.
5/31/16, 12:17 PM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
5/31/16, 12:18 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lmao
5/31/16, 12:18 PM ~ james e mooradian~ That weight is judging you
5/31/16, 1:19 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Life's ain't easy in the Valley. And those town's folk wonder why they always find you passed out in weird places.

6/1/16, 10:24 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Should try to deck out the rav4 like this dude's van. Maybe hands paint the word 'Grape' on the side too.
6/1/16, 10:58 AM ~ Sean B~ Damn that thing is sick
6/1/16, 11:24 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Pretty much my dream hustle wagon if I could confirm there's an onboard shower
6/1/16, 11:26 AM ~ Sean B~ Been following this Instagram lately it's pretty awesome for van stuff http://instagram.com/projectvanlife
6/1/16, 11:27 AM ~ Sean B~ Helping me get amped up for my trip
6/1/16, 12:11 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Nice. Looks really idyllic. Good thing the photos don't capture things like BO and swamp ass.
6/1/16, 12:14 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah shitting into a bucket doesn't make as good of an Instagram shot
6/1/16, 12:24 PM ~ Dave Wu~ And wiping. Looking at some fertile ground for dingleberries. Now that you bring up the bathroom situation. I don't think I could part ways with modern plumbing. I think I'll settle for minimalist living in a small city space.
6/1/16, 12:25 PM ~ Sean B~ Butt wipes are a pretty good solution for dingleberries
6/1/16, 12:26 PM ~ Sean B~ But yeah a tiny house with real plumbing would be cool too
6/1/16, 12:29 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I might be the Kobe of taking dumps, but Kobe misses shot too. And that's when running water is needed.
6/1/16, 1:26 PM ~ james e mooradian~ You can always go the 'tiny homes' route
6/1/16, 1:27 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Get a minimalist space saver
6/1/16, 1:27 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Bonus points for making it mobile so you can attach to a pickup or something
6/1/16, 1:28 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah you can get a pretty nice one for less than a down payment on a regular house in New England
6/1/16, 1:28 PM ~ james e mooradian~ <Media omitted>
6/1/16, 1:28 PM ~ Sean B~ Only issue id have is it would be hard to ever have guests visit
6/1/16, 1:28 PM ~ Dave Wu~ or shipping container
6/1/16, 1:28 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I think a lot of them require mostly DIY effort though
6/1/16, 1:29 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lol yeah just gotta commit to your small social/family unit
6/1/16, 1:32 PM ~ Dave Wu~ There was a time when families were all packed into one small cabin bed. And somehow the mother was always cranking out more farmhands.
6/1/16, 9:40 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol yeah I wonder how they managed that
6/2/16, 12:39 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Saw a spread of free food in the break room, thought no one was around, exclaimed'Oooo weeee' like Mr. PB......VP of finance is standing right behind me
6/2/16, 12:42 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Look them in the eye and say 'this little poopybutthole is hungry!'
6/2/16, 12:43 PM ~ james e mooradian~ That's how you win respect
6/2/16, 12:46 PM ~ Dave Wu~ haha or it becomes a 'Dave now works at the local gas station, he makes $8.50 an hour, he goes home smelling of gasoline.... when keeping it real goes wrong.'
6/2/16, 12:55 PM ~ james e mooradian~ No way dude
6/2/16, 12:55 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Ct minimum wage is 9.60
6/2/16, 12:55 PM ~ james e mooradian~ You got this
6/2/16, 1:46 PM ~ Alex C~ Haha lol-ed thinking of actually saying 'this poopy butthole is hungry!' to an upper management type. I don't think they can fire you for something like that though. Did I tell you about that guy who was wiping with ass gaskets at work and then putting them back in the gasket dispenser? Couldn't fire him because he had some kind of religious reason for doing it. You just have to say Mr. PB's a religious figure to you, Dave
6/2/16, 1:49 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Mr PB is a long time family friend lol. There was just some awkward small talk in the break room. Um what are ass gaskets? Sounds buttstuff-esq. And they come out of a dispenser?
6/2/16, 1:50 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Wait, he was wiping his ass with gaskets?
6/2/16, 1:51 PM ~ Dave Wu~ OK Google searched. never knew the covers were called gaskets.
6/2/16, 1:52 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Oh the toilet seat covers
6/2/16, 1:52 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I literally thought of a gasket like from an engine
6/2/16, 1:53 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Same. Especially with Alex working in a mech e lab.
6/2/16, 1:53 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Like why would he use gaskets when he'd have to assumedly sneak into a mechanic drawer with his pants down
6/2/16, 1:55 PM ~ Alex C~ Haha, I don't know now that you mention it if ass gasket is widely accepted nomenclature. A friend of mine once overheard a small child in a public restroom call them ass gaskets and the term just caught on haha
6/2/16, 1:56 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I mean technically that child isn't wrong
6/2/16, 1:57 PM ~ Alex C~ <Media omitted>
6/2/16, 2:01 PM ~ Dave Wu~ ah the junction between ass and bowl
6/2/16, 2:02 PM ~ Dave Wu~ but that's pretty nasty that the guy was putting the gaskets back in the box. Was he just stuffing them back in or neatly slipping them back in with Hershey stains and all?
6/2/16, 2:03 PM ~ Dave Wu~ And that's one reason to air dump to
6/2/16, 2:03 PM ~ Dave Wu~ too*
6/2/16, 2:03 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I mean I know a lot of other countries don't flush tp
6/2/16, 2:04 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Maybe he thought the to dispenser came with a neat little garbage at the bottom
6/2/16, 2:04 PM ~ Alex C~ I think just stuffing them back in. I imagine an absolute nightmare scenario for a germaphobe reaching for the protection of a gasket only to be betrayed
6/2/16, 2:05 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Forever uncleeeean
6/2/16, 2:05 PM ~ Alex C~ Hahaha
6/2/16, 2:10 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Lol. Curious how did your building find out it it was him?  Was there a memo go around about dookie butter on toilet covers?
6/2/16, 2:12 PM ~ Alex C~ This actually occurred at a friend of mine's company. She works in HR and it was reported to them. At around the same time there was also a mystery person leaving dookies in paper bags around the office. Separate offender who was ultimately fired once discovered.
6/2/16, 2:13 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Man, double trouble with those duke-related crimes
6/2/16, 2:14 PM ~ Dave Wu~ shit on Debra's desk... like a boss
6/2/16, 2:14 PM ~ Dave Wu~ that came to mind in terms is office turd offences
6/2/16, 2:14 PM ~ Dave Wu~ of*
6/2/16, 2:17 PM ~ Alex C~ They say acts of that nature usually come in 2's hiiiyyooo
6/2/16, 2:24 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lool
6/2/16, 2:35 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Poop stories are always a riot. The office is probably wondering why I'm laughing in my cube.
6/2/16, 7:07 PM ~ Sean B~ Wow that was quite a convo guys
6/2/16, 7:29 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Notice my town is covered in signs about parents getting charged if underage kids are caught drinking in the house. Must be that time of year when parents are on vacation and kids throw the classic high school banger.
6/2/16, 7:40 PM ~ Sean B~ Prom too
6/2/16, 7:40 PM ~ Sean B~ Takes me back to the ole vodka in Poland spring bottle days

6/3/16, 11:15 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Looks pretty neat
6/3/16, 11:30 AM ~ Sean B~ Feels pretty good, haven't sleep in it yet.  Gonna try it out over the weekend
6/3/16, 12:39 PM ~ Dave Wu~ When are you leaving for your walkabout?
6/3/16, 12:39 PM ~ Alex C~ And where are you going again?
6/3/16, 12:44 PM ~ Sean B~ 2 month cross country road trip
6/3/16, 12:44 PM ~ Sean B~ Leaving next week
6/3/16, 3:27 PM ~ Sean B~ Taking roy off the grid.  Don't even have a social security number for Roy
6/3/16, 3:29 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Huh, just learned that the good ole bertuckies pizza place originated from Somerville. Also marshmallow fluff too.
6/3/16, 3:33 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Never do back to the carpet store
6/3/16, 3:33 PM ~ Dave Wu~ go*

6/5/16, 10:51 AM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
6/5/16, 11:01 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Despite all the hipster/yuppie shit associated with cold brew, I think there's more caffeine. Apparently I'm supposed to dilute it but drinking it straight gives the ole brain balls a nice rubbing.
6/5/16, 11:44 AM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha
6/5/16, 12:43 PM ~ Alex C~ Probably keeps you regular too.
6/5/16, 1:44 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Shaq regular

6/8/16, 8:19 PM ~ Alex C~ So I'm going to India next Tuesday for a week and I've been trying to prepare as best as possible. During my researches I came across this hilarious video of how to use an eastern latrine that I would highly recommend: https://youtu.be/dKkryfdtMNQ
6/8/16, 8:19 PM ~ Alex C~ It's part of a series of instructional videos on how to crap around the world.
6/9/16, 1:23 PM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
6/9/16, 3:02 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol
6/9/16, 3:12 PM ~ Alex C~ So dark and so funny
6/9/16, 3:17 PM ~ Sean B~ Also that toilet video is awesome.  I'm sure you'll have a good poop story or two from your trip
6/10/16, 1:26 PM ~ Dave Wu~ So I guess I was supposed to help organize my high school class reunion..... whoops
6/13/16, 12:46 PM ~ Dave Wu~ When I encounter a biscotti I don't get the urge to revisit the James. It's more like damn I need to read some books and switch on the NPR.
6/13/16, 12:47 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lmao
6/13/16, 12:47 PM ~ james e mooradian~ That's the james for late twenties guys
6/13/16, 12:51 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Also, I tried my hand at cold brew coffee this week and holy shit
6/13/16, 12:52 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Tastes great and I'm buzzing my brain balls off
6/13/16, 12:52 PM ~ james e mooradian~ 10/10 would recommend with some fresh artisan loaves
6/13/16, 1:02 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol nice
6/13/16, 1:03 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah it's real easy to make
6/13/16, 4:22 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Alex, or maybe Jim, do you know any nice cheap food places in Madison? Need to ford river there.
6/13/16, 4:42 PM ~ Alex C~ Grand Apizza on Main Street is great pizza and pretty standard prices. The simple sauce and Parmesan apizza is my favorite
6/13/16, 5:34 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Nice, flipped through the menu. Seems pretty reasonable. #mungojerry

6/22/16, 11:02 AM ~ james e mooradian~ My beard/outdoorsman game just isn't up to par
6/22/16, 11:02 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Clearly the compiler knows this
6/22/16, 11:07 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Damn, Microsoft is pretty harsh with the error notifications.
6/22/16, 12:42 PM ~ Dave Wu~ It's pretty mind boggling how many dating profiles sound the same. 'Love to laugh' ect.  Starting to wonder is there a template for their profiles or is there just a horde of cookie cutter basic girls?
6/22/16, 3:15 PM ~ Sean B~ I think it's because they don't read other girls profiles so they think they're being original
6/22/16, 3:33 PM ~ Dave Wu~ But that would still mean the vast majority of girls still think similarly. Maybe everyone strives toward creating a benign sounding profile that shit just converges toward the same phrases and diction.
6/22/16, 3:45 PM ~ james e mooradian~ For some reason I'm reminded of the Dave Chappelle stand-up about stereotypes. Like middle class white girls have a genetic predisposition towards enjoying laughter
6/22/16, 3:46 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Everyone enjoys broadly enjoyable activities
6/22/16, 3:51 PM ~ james e mooradian~ That and most people probably won't put too many truly personal things on a dating website, so the amount of socially acceptable things to say about yourself ends up being pretty limited
6/22/16, 3:52 PM ~ james e mooradian~ But I also don't know shit about social media anymore so who the fuck knows
6/22/16, 3:53 PM ~ Sean B~ I think the majority of people aren't very interesting (remember uconn?) or they are playing it safe by trying to focus on widely relatable things, thinking that will give them the most appeal.  But that's actually not a good strategy.  Better to focus on specific more unique things and appeal to a smaller number of better matched people.  But it takes time to learn that
6/22/16, 3:54 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Basically, farmersonly.com is doing it right
6/22/16, 3:54 PM ~ Dave Wu~ wwbhwd
6/22/16, 3:56 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah it's all about that niche appeal
6/22/16, 4:03 PM ~ Dave Wu~ But I guess for girls on online dating sites it's not necessary to have niche appeal when they'll still receive a bunch of messages/likes/swipes. More important for guys though.
6/22/16, 4:05 PM ~ Sean B~ I dunno I still think it's a better strategy for them.  A hundred irrelevant dick pics isn't very valuable
6/22/16, 4:07 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Does 'a mouth is a mouth' apply to dick pics?
6/22/16, 4:55 PM ~ Dave Wu~ lol
6/22/16, 4:57 PM ~ Dave Wu~ off topic from dating, but Sean, are you still using the 5 minute artisan recipe for your breads or are you on some next level knead formulas.
6/22/16, 5:10 PM ~ Sean B~ I'm using different recipes now.  Moved on to wild yeast sourdough which is requires a longer process
6/22/16, 7:01 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Ah. Any recipe suggestions for a solid intermediate bake?
6/22/16, 8:07 PM ~ Sean B~ I've been using the book 'classic sourdoughs' but I think the King Arthur website also has some good ones for free
6/23/16, 8:53 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
6/23/16, 9:15 PM ~ Dave Wu~ looks like you're about to chop some trees.
6/23/16, 9:21 PM ~ Sean B~ Paul Bunyan-wave
6/24/16, 2:34 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Oooo weeee if the economy sours with the brexit and our jobs are unscathed, might be a nice time to buddy up and make property investments. Sphincter to asset acquisition might getting a little looser.
6/24/16, 2:35 PM ~ Dave Wu~ of course property values usually take longer to dip in a crisis. need sustained bad times
6/24/16, 2:51 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lol that's thinking
6/24/16, 2:51 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I'm just content that my line of work tends to pick up during economic crises
6/24/16, 2:52 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Governments desperate to pay for shit
6/24/16, 2:52 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Also Sean those pics have been simultaneously awesome and depressing
6/24/16, 2:53 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I look outside and instead of mountain ranges I see homeless people casually smoking crack next to a run down subway
6/24/16, 2:53 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Pretty jealous
6/24/16, 2:53 PM ~ Dave Wu~ toll roads... got that rib sandwich on lock, you gots to come through me
6/24/16, 2:54 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Yup. Plus no politician wants to raise taxes these days
6/24/16, 2:55 PM ~ Dave Wu~ yeah definitely feel a bit for depressed to when I see Sean's pics. Makes me wanna get a tiny house and take Roy off the grid.
6/24/16, 2:55 PM ~ Dave Wu~ too*
6/24/16, 3:46 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol
6/24/16, 3:46 PM ~ Sean B~ I'm hoping to inspire rather than depress
6/24/16, 4:00 PM ~ james e mooradian~ It's okay man. The carpet store is pretty comfy
6/24/16, 4:01 PM ~ Dave Wu~ The carpet store only gets comfy when you reach for off white Persians
6/24/16, 4:03 PM ~ Dave Wu~ But for real I've been looking into tiny living options. Really want to amass a variety of tiny places in different locations.
6/24/16, 4:41 PM ~ Sean B~ Dude get a van I'll help you mod it
6/24/16, 4:43 PM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
6/24/16, 4:46 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Still modern plumbing. Running water is the shit.
6/24/16, 7:28 PM ~ james e mooradian~ HAHAHA
6/24/16, 7:29 PM ~ james e mooradian~ That was fucking gold
6/24/16, 7:29 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Srsly would be pretty neat to do something like that
6/24/16, 7:31 PM ~ james e mooradian~ There was an imgur post the other day with a guy who made an apartment out of 3 shipping containers, was pretty cool
6/24/16, 7:33 PM ~ james e mooradian~ And there's a fair amount of people who are into efficient houses with energy/water/gardening all fully self sufficient
6/24/16, 7:34 PM ~ james e mooradian~ It's been awhile since I did research on that but I think they're called earth ships or something similar
6/24/16, 11:08 PM ~ Sean B~ That's what I'm talking about

6/26/16, 1:00 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
6/26/16, 2:47 PM ~ james e mooradian~ That's a nice lookin loaf
6/26/16, 2:48 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Is it tough baking bread on the road?
6/26/16, 2:48 PM ~ Sean B~ Nah I'm staying with friends this weekend so they had all the equipment.  Just used store yeast
6/26/16, 2:50 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Oh nice. Gotta keep those bread skills sharp during your travels
6/26/16, 2:50 PM ~ Sean B~ Yep
6/26/16, 2:51 PM ~ Dave Wu~ what type of loaf is it?
6/26/16, 2:51 PM ~ Sean B~ Just classic white French boule
6/26/16, 4:28 PM ~ Dave Wu~ ah classic white balls.
6/26/16, 4:29 PM ~ Dave Wu~ and that pic looks like it could on the cover of a book.
6/26/16, 4:32 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Just a Breeze Bread by the Sneaky Baker
6/26/16, 4:33 PM ~ Dave Wu~ with foreword written by Tony Eveready
6/26/16, 5:59 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha
6/26/16, 5:59 PM ~ Sean B~ Love it
6/26/16, 6:47 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Okay, fuck it. Gonna throw my hat into the bread ring
6/26/16, 6:47 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Reading up on yeast culturing now
6/26/16, 6:48 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Might try a few easy recipes while the yeast is growing
6/26/16, 9:24 PM ~ Sean B~ Awww shit
6/26/16, 10:59 PM ~ Sean B~ Watch jim be dominating all of us in bread making within like a week
6/26/16, 11:00 PM ~ Sean B~ Kneading with one hand while simultaneously hand grinding locally sourced grain with the other and casually carrying a conversation
6/26/16, 11:02 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lmao
6/26/16, 11:02 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Basting that turkey
6/26/16, 11:03 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Baking seems a lot different from cooking meat tbh
6/28/16, 10:31 AM ~ Alex C~ Butze, that picture you posted of a goat on Idaho is pretty much exactly as I would imagine that state haha
6/28/16, 10:56 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Idaho is a pretty sweet place minus the sketchy conservative area in the north. Think the state is usually associated with living off the grid or preferred locale for laying low.
6/28/16, 11:21 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Also, potatoes
6/28/16, 11:30 AM ~ Dave Wu~ yeah the spuds too
6/28/16, 11:57 AM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
6/28/16, 11:58 AM ~ Sean B~ But yeah I know.  It was at a gas station too.  Livestock just wandering around
6/28/16, 11:59 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Lol I was secretly wondering what the goat was about
6/28/16, 12:00 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Thought I missed something
6/28/16, 12:00 PM ~ Sean B~ Nope I just have to post every photo twice because you're a damn Luddite hahaha
6/28/16, 12:03 PM ~ Dave Wu~ ah Luddite one of my fave pejoratives
6/28/16, 12:13 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
6/28/16, 12:13 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
6/28/16, 12:14 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Oh speaking of tiny houses, there's an entire show on HGTV devoted to them
6/28/16, 12:14 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Tiny house, big living
6/28/16, 12:15 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Found out about it the other day
6/28/16, 12:18 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I've thought of mortgaging a set of prefab tiny houses in a vacation type area ie Ludlow and renting then out
6/28/16, 12:19 PM ~ Dave Wu~ though vacation rentals is a fickle business especially with climate change.
6/28/16, 12:19 PM ~ Dave Wu~ And I think I need to take a gander at that rosebud house lol
6/28/16, 12:19 PM ~ james e mooradian~ A lot of the ski resorts seem to be struggling to survive these days
6/28/16, 12:23 PM ~ Dave Wu~ ole fashion primary living space is the safest bet. Seen some tiny house community concepts, but they resemble trailer parks. But trailer parks aren't they the o
6/28/16, 12:23 PM ~ Dave Wu~ OG tiny houses. Just associated with being poor.
6/28/16, 12:24 PM ~ Sean B~ Poor is the new rich
6/28/16, 12:24 PM ~ Dave Wu~ So it's rebranded for the progressive folks.
6/28/16, 12:25 PM ~ Dave Wu~ kinda like peasant loafs, uncovered brick walls and loose hanging Edison bulbs
6/28/16, 12:26 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah I mean pretty much everything cool today is derived from being poor a century ago.  Making your own food, living small, etc
6/28/16, 12:27 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Yeah the whole internet cottage industry, handmade, local grown is what the majority of people did back in the day.... well minus the internet part
6/28/16, 12:28 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Just add wifi and 3d printing to early 1900s poverty and you've got yourself a bohemian comminity
6/28/16, 12:30 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I've been searching for this NPR segment about local grown stuff and how it doesn't solve any world problems. It's the most inefficient easy to make crops to supply an ever growing population.
6/28/16, 12:31 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Basically we're taking steps backwards to be cool when society has reached a point where we can't be dicking around with small scale personal pizza shit
6/28/16, 12:33 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah.  It's not about efficiency though it's more about entertainment.  People who do it i.e. us can afford the premium
6/28/16, 12:33 PM ~ Sean B~ My sourdough loaves probably take $100 of labor at least.  Not efficient in the least but fun as hell
6/28/16, 12:34 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Assuming you're working your hourly rate, yeah
6/28/16, 12:34 PM ~ james e mooradian~ If you can fill 100% of your free time with work at-rate, that's the loss you take
6/28/16, 12:35 PM ~ james e mooradian~ But it's not always the case
6/28/16, 12:35 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Welp remember those beers I've have y'all.... it's gonna cost you lol
6/28/16, 12:35 PM ~ Sean B~ No even for a baker's wage to bake just a few loaves a week would be about that expensive
6/28/16, 12:36 PM ~ Sean B~ But again, not about the efficiency in these cases
6/28/16, 12:37 PM ~ james e mooradian~ You mean in terms of what it would take to survive with that amount of production? Definitely true in that case
6/28/16, 12:37 PM ~ Dave Wu~ yeah if you factor in the oven, the building the oven is in and other normally overlooked costs it'd definitely come out to at least $100
6/28/16, 12:38 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Artisan is such a weird thing, but it has a quality that's probably important culturally
6/28/16, 12:38 PM ~ james e mooradian~ We have to balance industrial thinking with holistic evaluation occasionally
6/28/16, 12:39 PM ~ Sean B~ For me I just find fulfillment in making things and learning how things are made.  Mass production is efficient but if that's all you consume it doesn't lead to a particularly interesting or fulfilling life IMO
6/28/16, 12:40 PM ~ Sean B~ Need a balance as Jim says
6/28/16, 12:40 PM ~ Sean B~ Like if I had to make everything myself that would not be very fun
6/28/16, 12:40 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I like making things but I like making things in mass. Probably why I enjoy how it's made and plumbuses
6/28/16, 12:42 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I guess I guess I'd everything was super lickety split efficient works would be very Soviet and cog life.
6/28/16, 12:42 PM ~ Dave Wu~ if*
6/28/16, 12:44 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah efficiency isn't everything
6/28/16, 12:45 PM ~ Sean B~ Some of the best things in life aren't efficient.  I.e. Wrapping a turkey in a bacon weave
6/28/16, 12:47 PM ~ Dave Wu~ For me balance would be society delegating resources to provide guaranteed proper resources water, basis food and shelter in the most efficient, industrial way possible.... establishing a baseline. Then amassing more or seeking creativity, personal growth is dicking around you can do on your own accord
6/28/16, 12:55 PM ~ Sean B~ You should work for the government.  Sounds like you have good macro-level ideas.  I tend to just focus on my self and hope the big picture works itself out via a plague or other catastrophic event
6/28/16, 12:57 PM ~ Dave Wu~ it's all motivated by self preservation.  I fear the proletariat as Marx calls them. It's programmed into my family history.
6/28/16, 12:59 PM ~ Dave Wu~ wish I could figure out a way to nip the whole class struggle problem in the bud before it gets out of hand
6/28/16, 1:02 PM ~ Alex C~ You guys are pretty much outlining the main theme of my dissertation, efficiency versus creativity. Efficiency is typically associated with uniformity and limited interaction whereas creativity depends on the interaction of a diverse set of things, whatever they may be. In the most optimal case, there's a balance where efficient structures facilitate creativity. The bronchioles in the lungs are a good example. Straight, uniform tubes branch and decrease in radius efficiently transporting air to oxygen absorption sites, which are exactly inefficient with respect to moving air, but amazingly effective at getting oxygen because their surfaces are so nonuniform and textured. It's all about efficiently bringing diverse sets of things together in a productive manner with minimal loss of each entity's unique character along the way.
6/28/16, 1:09 PM ~ Sean B~ http://giphy.com/gifs/tim-and-eric-mind-blown-EldfH1VJdbrwY
6/28/16, 1:09 PM ~ Sean B~ That's amazing
6/28/16, 1:10 PM ~ Alex C~ Blew my mind too. That little piece of math that James showed me lead to a whole derivation that made the lungs thing clear to me
6/28/16, 1:11 PM ~ Sean B~ Fuckin algebraic
6/28/16, 1:11 PM ~ Alex C~ Literally
6/28/16, 1:14 PM ~ Dave Wu~ That's one hell of an analogy... wow
6/28/16, 1:22 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I definitely think the food industry suffers from the downside of industrialization these days, probably why artisan foods are so popular. Although most of the ire seems to be directed at the least problematic things that were doing to foodstuffs
6/28/16, 1:23 PM ~ james e mooradian~ We could benefit from some more food bronchioles, is what I think I'm saying
6/28/16, 1:24 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Or maybe from more studies of evolution in design
6/28/16, 1:25 PM ~ Dave Wu~ as long as those bronchioles aren't asthmatic and deliberately limiting airflow
6/28/16, 1:25 PM ~ james e mooradian~ There was a really cool study of urban growth that involved modeling cities with mold colonies
6/28/16, 1:25 PM ~ james e mooradian~ One of my grad student friends was working on it. Horribly boring day to day but a really neat end result
6/28/16, 1:29 PM ~ Alex C~ The food industry also gets the benefit of efficiency with respect to food sanitation. Just came back from India where the food is amazing, all 'home-cooked' style, but it'll give you horrible shits. I was like a faucet for a week and I took all the precautions. Really need to strike a balance somehow. Also that's really cool with the mold study. I saw people using that analogy to model empty planes getting reforested in that show cooked. Somehow it seems to make sense that it would also be applicable to city growth
6/28/16, 1:31 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Definitely look forward to hearing some of your (probably poo related) stories from india
6/28/16, 1:33 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I'm guessing immune systems play into that too, or at least similar tolerances. Aru says she has to be super careful eating food in India, and she was born there
6/28/16, 1:34 PM ~ james e mooradian~ But her family that's lived there their whole lives have no issue
6/28/16, 5:13 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Intestinal flora is like an island with some shared species with the people in your area (basis of the poop transplant). Go to another place and you got totally different species. Those new bacteria in the gut are like north American field mice making it to Australia... buffet.
6/28/16, 5:13 PM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
6/28/16, 7:38 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol
6/28/16, 7:57 PM ~ Dave Wu~ that's an example of when plug and chug with Google translate goes wrong.
6/28/16, 7:57 PM ~ Dave Wu~ also super entertaining to go to an Asian market and read translations on packages

6/29/16, 11:23 AM ~ Dave Wu~ View is on the break room TV again. Not sure if I can buy into the stuff spouting out of these daytime talkshow folks. Clearly biased because Ja Rule is noticeably absent from the discussion. #jaruleforscotusjustice
6/29/16, 11:24 AM ~ Dave Wu~ and Sean awesome you made it to the west cost
6/29/16, 11:25 AM ~ Dave Wu~ coast*. Are you looping down the ca and venturing into the south next?
6/29/16, 11:26 AM ~ Sean B~ No going to Washington and then to Banff in Alberta then Montana
6/29/16, 11:26 AM ~ Sean B~ Really wanted to do the southwest but it's too damn hot there right now
6/29/16, 11:30 AM ~ Dave Wu~ nice. are hitting up Yellowstone and the grand titons?
6/29/16, 11:31 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Sounds like a pretty sweet trip so far
6/29/16, 11:31 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Watch out for them grizzles
6/29/16, 11:32 AM ~ Dave Wu~ manbearpig
6/29/16, 11:32 AM ~ Sean B~ Not sure if I'll have time after Montana but I would like to at least see the Tetons.  Them warlocks are supposed to be pretty impressive

6/30/16, 6:25 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I think I'm about to bump heads with upper management. Called them out for leaving our technicians out of a software selection process with office wide implications.
6/30/16, 6:45 PM ~ Sean B~ Are you gonna decide to keep it real ?
6/30/16, 6:46 PM ~ Dave Wu~ DMX

6/30/16, 7:05 PM ~ Sean B~ I told them it means world peace
7/1/16, 9:29 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Yeah it's about to turn in to that. Actually pretty pissed I'm left with the holding down clinical stuff with the techs while the rest of the office is meeting with the vendor.
7/1/16, 9:31 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Fuck I'm about to straight lead a revolt.
7/1/16, 9:31 AM ~ Dave Wu~ up*
7/1/16, 9:36 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Ah, so more like this Rick and Morty clip
7/1/16, 9:36 AM ~ james e mooradian~ <Media omitted>
7/1/16, 9:38 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Srsly though it's probably a good idea to remind them not to treat you and the techs like indentured servants
7/1/16, 9:53 AM ~ Dave Wu~ I'm more concerned about the techs they get paid a lot less but hold down a shot ton
7/1/16, 9:55 AM ~ Dave Wu~ shit* of important work. Struggling here to bring balance to the workplace.
7/1/16, 9:55 AM ~ Dave Wu~ And yeah that scene from Rick and Morty sums it up.
7/1/16, 10:01 AM ~ Dave Wu~ If any of y'all ever start companies don't forget take into account all the folks that work with you... janitorial staff too. Guess this is what I picked up from Costco and historical or personal observation. Better long term gains.

7/2/16, 3:32 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah it does
7/2/16, 4:36 PM ~ Alex C~ Nice, we're about to try out the bread oven down in Madison
7/2/16, 4:55 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Aw shiit
7/2/16, 9:25 PM ~ Sean B~ Nice!!
7/2/16, 9:25 PM ~ Sean B~ Send pics
7/2/16, 9:57 PM ~ Alex C~ Missed the opportunity to take pics this time, but we're going to fire it up again tomorrow. The pizzas today came out amazing

7/3/16, 5:11 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Dave I know it's super far for you but would you want to come over to Brooklyn for the 4th?
7/3/16, 5:11 PM ~ james e mooradian~ You're more than welcome to
7/3/16, 5:12 PM ~ james e mooradian~ It's just gonna be me, the twins, and 4 or 5 of their friends

7/7/16, 12:52 PM ~ Dave Wu~ We're having an office culture discussion. Figuring out people stuff and activities is difficult. Feels like planning a high school pep rally.
7/7/16, 12:55 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I like the concept of a team, but the the micro bits are to APM intensive.
7/8/16, 10:45 PM ~ Alex C~ Just saw this hilarious clip from a Netflix movie where Paul Rudd's trying to get a kid to try a slim Jim and he keeps saying 'come on! Nibble the Jim! Take a bite of the James!'

7/12/16, 9:37 PM ~ Alex C~ And there's a snorlax
7/12/16, 9:37 PM ~ Alex C~ A little app called PowerPoint

7/14/16, 12:25 AM ~ Dave Wu~ oh shit someone got fancy
7/14/16, 12:25 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Lol
7/14/16, 12:25 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Yeah I decided to give it a go
7/14/16, 12:25 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Boule is difficult to eat for me cos I apparently only own shitty dull knives
7/14/16, 12:26 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Just winged the braid
7/14/16, 12:26 AM ~ Sean B~ Nice
7/14/16, 12:26 AM ~ james e mooradian~ First attempt did not go as well but I blame my old ass bake ware
7/14/16, 12:27 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Bits of my baking sheet came off in the bottom crust of the boule
7/14/16, 12:29 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Dave helped me with the dough making on this one. Dat giant costco bag of flour
7/14/16, 12:30 AM ~ Sean B~ Looks like the gauntlet has been thrown down. Gonna have to step my game up when I get home.
7/14/16, 12:31 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Looking forward to dat bake off
7/14/16, 12:32 AM ~ james e mooradian~ We'll have to try out some recipes for Alex's bread stove
7/14/16, 12:32 AM ~ Dave Wu~ think I'm gonna pick up a different niche cooking activity.... maybe pickling
7/14/16, 12:33 AM ~ Sean B~ Bake off would be awesome
7/14/16, 12:33 AM ~ james e mooradian~ I gotta say I like the brewing/baking combo you got going on
7/14/16, 12:33 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Nice synergy
7/14/16, 12:34 AM ~ Sean B~ But yeah would also be good to round out the portfolio with more niche skills
7/14/16, 12:34 AM ~ james e mooradian~ You add in some pickles and maybe some smoked meats and you've got yourself a nice picnic
7/14/16, 12:34 AM ~ Sean B~ Thinking about trying cheese and butter
7/14/16, 12:35 AM ~ Dave Wu~ then we can open an artisan goods shop in some gentrified area
7/14/16, 12:35 AM ~ Sean B~ We could start our own commune at that point
7/14/16, 12:35 AM ~ Dave Wu~ get some San serif font packaging
7/14/16, 12:35 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Jams/preserves are a hot ticket item as well
7/14/16, 12:37 AM ~ Sean B~ Aw yeah
7/14/16, 12:37 AM ~ Sean B~ Get some chutneys up in this bitch
7/14/16, 12:38 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Seriously though I'm excited to hang out with you guys again
7/14/16, 12:38 AM ~ james e mooradian~ It'll be a good time catching up
7/14/16, 12:38 AM ~ Sean B~ Same sues
7/14/16, 12:38 AM ~ Sean B~ Samesies *
7/14/16, 12:39 AM ~ Dave Wu~ should plan on labor days
7/14/16, 12:39 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Also I accidentally made some really delicious burgers that I definitely wanna recreate ASAP
7/14/16, 12:39 AM ~ Dave Wu~ ass burgers?
7/14/16, 12:39 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Lol
7/14/16, 12:40 AM ~ Sean B~ Niiice
7/14/16, 12:40 AM ~ Sean B~ Yeah let's do Labor Day
7/14/16, 12:40 AM ~ james e mooradian~ 'so good you'll end up on the autism spectrum'
7/14/16, 12:40 AM ~ Dave Wu~ lol ref to the south park shit episode
7/14/16, 12:40 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Yup
7/14/16, 12:41 AM ~ james e mooradian~ I'll keep labor day clear
7/14/16, 12:42 AM ~ Sean B~ Unrelated but I'm drinking in a hostel in Vancouver with a bunch of foreigners and apparently Australians refer to pedophiles as 'kiddie fiddlers' and I thought that was hilarious
7/14/16, 12:43 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Lmao that's gold
7/14/16, 12:44 AM ~ Dave Wu~ haha...peeeedo
7/14/16, 12:45 AM ~ james e mooradian~ I just ate the whole loaf...

7/14/16, 4:21 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Oh actually no I know
7/14/16, 4:21 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Nm
7/14/16, 4:21 PM ~ Dave Wu~ meth

7/14/16, 4:22 PM ~ james e mooradian~ At 1 in the morning
7/14/16, 6:30 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha
7/14/16, 9:05 PM ~ Dave Wu~ First time I saw the marked safe feature on Facebook used. I guess it's the next evolution of social media towards more meaningful purposes.

7/15/16, 12:52 PM ~ Sean B~ Nice
7/15/16, 12:52 PM ~ Sean B~ I'm down
7/15/16, 12:57 PM ~ Dave Wu~ the beauty of fermented/preserved foods is their increased shelf life. Though at the expense of longer/riskier lead time.
7/15/16, 1:02 PM ~ Dave Wu~ or you could always repack someone else's bulk generic product into smaller nicely labeled portions. And float the price increase on our beards and membership in the millennial age group.
7/17/16, 3:39 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
7/18/16, 4:19 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Had to call up a guy after denying his wife's medications. Was unhappy he had to pick up an OTC made in Japan. Guy went on a nativist rant about immigrants receiving free benefits and what not. My mind drifted off to thoughts of similar people in a mass, current and past upwellings of populism and the consequences.... not surprised by his sentiments but it left me with a sinking feeling regarding humanity.
7/19/16, 2:21 PM ~ Alex C~ Well at least there's always Pokemon
7/19/16, 2:24 PM ~ Alex C~ Also, just want to share that I had the opportunity to shit in the woods twice this weekend during a two day backpacking trip with my dad and his coworkers. Amazing and recommendable experience. Very liberating. Butze, have you tried it yet? Also, we should do a section of the long trail some time soon. Can't believe I didn't try out backpacking earlier. So fun
7/19/16, 2:30 PM ~ Dave Wu~ amazing referring to backpacking or releasing the chocolate dragon in the woods?
7/19/16, 2:50 PM ~ Alex C~ Both and now also to calling it 'releasing the chocolate dragon' hahaha
7/19/16, 2:54 PM ~ Dave Wu~ https://youtu.be/zM1P0oc2-es
7/19/16, 2:54 PM ~ Dave Wu~ ref.
7/20/16, 10:28 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Jim, is that feasibility study for CT mileage tax something you'll be doing?
7/20/16, 10:29 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Not me specifically
7/20/16, 10:29 AM ~ james e mooradian~ But my company is
7/20/16, 10:35 AM ~ Dave Wu~ ah. so there won't be reports with a picture of you giving a double thumbs up.
7/20/16, 10:36 AM ~ Dave Wu~ that's how I imagine your feasibility reports ending for clients
7/20/16, 10:37 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Usually is
7/20/16, 10:48 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Always thought the wacarnolds rib sandwich toll strategy would be best. Mileage tax just seems about as annoying as old school electric/gas meter reads.
7/20/16, 10:49 AM ~ james e mooradian~ We have problems with the mileage tax tbh
7/20/16, 10:49 AM ~ james e mooradian~ If it replaces gas tax it doesn't favor one type of vehicle over another
7/20/16, 10:50 AM ~ james e mooradian~ No incentive to reduce emissions or increase fuel efficiency
7/20/16, 10:50 AM ~ Dave Wu~ right. long distance heavy commuters would be hit the hardest.
7/20/16, 10:51 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Yeah
7/20/16, 10:51 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Tolls still look like the best alt on my end
7/20/16, 10:51 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Can offer programs for commuters on facilities
7/20/16, 10:52 AM ~ Dave Wu~ so then you should change your Altima to a Hummer
7/20/16, 10:52 AM ~ james e mooradian~ And free alternatives
7/20/16, 10:54 AM ~ Dave Wu~ yeah those no booth tolls on mass Pike are pretty sweet. Alternatives like CT fast trak? Seems like a good amount of people actually use it.
7/20/16, 6:26 PM ~ Sean B~ Sup yallll 😄 just got back on the grid again.  Courtney and I were backpacking in the Canadian Rockies for 3 days.  To answer your question Alex yes I have shit in the woods, a few times in Colorado and it is awesome.  Surprisingly the two places I've been backpacking though have both had outhouses at the campsites so no hole-squatting there
7/20/16, 6:26 PM ~ Sean B~ Probably because they're national parks and they want to reduce impact on the environment.  Human dookie all over the place isn't great I guess
7/20/16, 6:28 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Sounds like a pretty rad time
7/20/16, 6:28 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Sean, are you still in mid-travelling, or are you back in the northeast?
7/20/16, 6:30 PM ~ Sean B~ Still traveling, returning in early August then going on a couple short trips.  So I'll see y'all Labor Day weekend hopefully
7/20/16, 6:38 PM ~ Dave Wu~ that's quite the walkabout.
7/20/16, 6:44 PM ~ Sean B~ Indeed

7/20/16, 8:41 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah dude it's the most insane place.  Even better than Colorado.  Google 'Banff' and look at the pics that come up.  Can't believe I had ever heard of this place
7/21/16, 10:14 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Banff...what a name... and that lake
7/21/16, 10:41 AM ~ Dave Wu~ And Pokemon in Somerville.... holy shit. It's just like firing up okc/bumble around here.
7/21/16, 11:07 AM ~ Sean B~ All those effing twenty somethings

7/21/16, 6:41 PM ~ Sean B~ Jesus
7/21/16, 6:41 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Cross promotion with a little a sprinkle of 0.5℅ discount on Wells Fargo loans for prime members. But either with the high fixed rate loan or the variable rate.... shit, it's playing just the tip.
7/21/16, 6:41 PM ~ Sean B~ Just a breeze loans
7/21/16, 6:53 PM ~ Dave Wu~ https://youtu.be/GoWblwKdeHg
7/21/16, 6:53 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Amazon lubing deals made me think of this old clip.
7/21/16, 7:01 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol such a classic
7/23/16, 11:33 AM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
7/23/16, 1:54 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Banff lake right?
7/23/16, 6:11 PM ~ Sean B~ It's called emerald lake.  There are a ton like that in the area though.  Minerals from the glaciers make it that color I think
7/24/16, 2:05 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Nice. Must be some serious copper in the water.
7/24/16, 2:05 PM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
7/24/16, 2:14 PM ~ Sean B~ LOL
7/24/16, 2:14 PM ~ Sean B~ So good
7/24/16, 11:16 PM ~ Sean B~ Alex did you defend your thesis yet?
7/25/16, 12:01 AM ~ Alex C~ Not yet, was a little set back by the India trip, aiming for end of August to defend.
7/25/16, 12:05 AM ~ Sean B~ Oooo he's tryin!
7/25/16, 12:06 AM ~ Alex C~ Hahaha sure am
7/25/16, 10:40 AM ~ Alex C~ So who's in for Hops in the Hills? It's August 6th and I'll be going up to VT on the 4th. Sean, I think you said you're traveling, but I figured I'd double check. Also, Jim, feel free to bring Aru if you're able to come. Dave, you should see the new brew equipment my dad's picked up. It's gettin serious haha
7/25/16, 11:26 AM ~ Sean B~ Aw man I really wanna come for that.  Leaving Montana on August 1st and was estimating I'd be back in mass on the 7th.  I guess there's a chance if I activate Wu-drive I could make it, but probably not super likely
7/25/16, 11:41 AM ~ james e mooradian~ :/ that's the weekend I fly out for my vacation
7/25/16, 11:42 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Hope you guys enjoy though
7/25/16, 11:42 AM ~ Sean B~ Jim's taking a vacation?? 😮
7/25/16, 12:02 PM ~ james e mooradian~ 2 vacations actually 😅
7/25/16, 12:03 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Though the second one is just to spend time with my parents/my dad's birthday
7/25/16, 12:21 PM ~ Sean B~ Damn son
7/25/16, 12:21 PM ~ Sean B~ Nice
7/25/16, 12:23 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I'm on call that weekend and I'll be in Somerville for some final clean up with for the rental.
7/25/16, 12:25 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Also I saw the Cascade brick your dad posted on fb. Wish my poopy butthole hops plants made that much hops flowers. Is he making an IPA?
7/25/16, 12:29 PM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
7/25/16, 12:29 PM ~ Sean B~ 😂😂😂
7/25/16, 1:37 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lmao
7/25/16, 11:09 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
7/26/16, 12:24 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Started reading the issue. Interesting to get the farmers perspective on food and their struggles.
7/26/16, 12:54 PM ~ Sean B~ Cool.  There's also a pair of articles outlining the global vs local food debate, very similar to what we were discussing a while back
7/26/16, 1:09 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Is the magazine also full of ads for super niche products?
7/26/16, 1:10 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I always enjoyed the advertisements for specific brands of manhole covers and blind pedestrian crosswalk location bumps
7/26/16, 1:14 PM ~ Sean B~ I'll have to check
7/26/16, 1:15 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
7/26/16, 1:15 PM ~ Dave Wu~ nothing really niche. It's not really an ad driven magazine. Looks like it's funded by various Canadian agricultural commission
7/26/16, 1:17 PM ~ Dave Wu~ so that technique works with pubes too right. Remember 'the hobbit' from urban dictionary.
7/26/16, 1:18 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol probably
7/26/16, 1:18 PM ~ Dave Wu~ wouldnt hair underwear be the most uncomfortable thing ever
7/26/16, 1:18 PM ~ Dave Wu~ almost like a 19th century anti masturbation device
7/26/16, 1:19 PM ~ Sean B~ I dunno maybe not. It does grow on/around your junk anyway
7/26/16, 1:30 PM ~ Dave Wu~ but hair naturally grows away from the body. Hair underwear would be like scrubbing your junk with a bristle brush.
7/26/16, 1:39 PM ~ Dave Wu~ well I hope we all don't get pube sweaters from you for Christmas
7/26/16, 4:52 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Was looking at Crock-Pots. There's Wi-Fi linked ones that can be controlled remotely. They just made the laziest cooking method even lazier.
7/26/16, 4:57 PM ~ Sean B~ Why would you even need that

7/27/16, 11:46 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Hilarious
7/27/16, 2:58 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Everyday I look out the kitchen window and the same bird squats over the deck rail and drops a deuce. Sometimes I start tapping on the window to scare it off. Instead of flying away, the bird turns it's head, stares me down, and proceeds to squeeze one out. This morning the 6 droppings formed an evenly spaced line in the rail. I'm getting trolled by nature.
7/27/16, 2:59 PM ~ Dave Wu~ on*
7/27/16, 2:59 PM ~ james e mooradian~ That's the first law of nature
7/27/16, 2:59 PM ~ james e mooradian~ All birds are assholes
7/27/16, 3:00 PM ~ Dave Wu~ can I borrow your stray cat?
7/27/16, 3:00 PM ~ james e mooradian~ You probably could benefit from a tabby wreaking some havoc
7/27/16, 3:00 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I think he got adopted though
7/27/16, 3:04 PM ~ Dave Wu~ ah bummer. Should've took it home with you after buying it dinner.
7/27/16, 3:09 PM ~ james e mooradian~ It hopefully at least has a better life now
7/27/16, 3:10 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Plus I'm not gonna leave a cat alone in an apartment for 3,4 days at a time
7/27/16, 3:10 PM ~ james e mooradian~ It ain't right
7/27/16, 3:17 PM ~ Dave Wu~ true. Cat probably would've gone to town on your apartment. Could always take it to work as a 'therapy animal', let it loose on clients you don't like.
7/27/16, 3:18 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Office cat?
7/27/16, 3:18 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Or enhance presentations with a cat
7/27/16, 3:18 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Really should design some app based remote pet care devices
7/27/16, 3:19 PM ~ Dave Wu~ yeah like a roomba
7/27/16, 3:19 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Just have a roomba mouse I can activate with my phone
7/27/16, 3:19 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Maybe a cat feeder and waterer
7/27/16, 3:20 PM ~ Dave Wu~ If that system existed, I drop a cat or two in my Somerville basement
7/27/16, 3:21 PM ~ james e mooradian~ It's probably doable with a raspberry pi or two
7/27/16, 3:21 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Maybe someone has something premade
7/27/16, 3:21 PM ~ james e mooradian~ That auto catfarm
7/27/16, 3:24 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Feed and Go Smart Pet Feeder with Webcam & Wi-Fi https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00UNQZ2QI/ref=cm_sw_r_wa_apa_APqMxbCVNQFFG
7/27/16, 3:24 PM ~ Dave Wu~ yep I guess they do exist.
7/27/16, 3:26 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lol nice
7/27/16, 3:26 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Just pair it with one of those weird mouse ball things and you've got yourself a remote pet
7/27/16, 3:27 PM ~ james e mooradian~ It will probably hate the shit out of you of you ever see it in person though
7/27/16, 3:28 PM ~ Dave Wu~ lol yeah. It would probably think it's owner is a electronic Tupperware box.
7/27/16, 3:28 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lol yeah
7/27/16, 3:28 PM ~ james e mooradian~ You're just the guy who restocks the shelvez
7/27/16, 3:29 PM ~ Dave Wu~ man serves the machine that serves the cat

8/2/16, 12:48 PM ~ Dave Wu~ when indie niche evolves into upscale cookie cutter. Jim probably gets to see this firsthand.
8/2/16, 12:56 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lol I am. Aru is really excites about the whole foods being opened
8/2/16, 12:58 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I gotta say though, I have no idea how some of those businesses on Bedford survive. A surprising amount of weird artsy junk still being sold
8/2/16, 1:02 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Most likely running at a loss. They'll get replaced by upscale chain. The non well heeled artsy folk and hipsters will then flock to the next cheap area.
8/2/16, 1:06 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Word on the street is Bronx is next. Large number of permits being issued in some areas... not sure how long this growth will sustain though... like yeast in bread, there's a limit to the number of CO2 bubble condos.
8/2/16, 1:07 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Hmm I would have thought it'd be queens
8/2/16, 1:12 PM ~ Dave Wu~ it's already happening in Queens
8/2/16, 1:18 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Bronx lofts by historic Fat Joe residence.
8/3/16, 10:17 AM ~ Dave Wu~ As Juvenile's hit song played in my head this morning, I thought to myself: The edited version with the chorus 'Back that thang up' would be perfect for a cloud based backup service commercial.

8/4/16, 9:35 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Sean if you can cop an 8 track recorder or laser disc press at a flea market, you could drop a TLS release on some uber limited release. Make a name on the music blogs.
8/4/16, 9:36 PM ~ Dave Wu~ laser disc is for vids though, so you could just set images of your junk to music... There's probably only 2 people on earth who can play it anyways.
8/4/16, 9:36 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol
8/4/16, 9:36 PM ~ Sean B~ There's no way I would break even on either of those

8/8/16, 5:18 PM ~ Sean B~ Welcome back, was getting worried about you.  Almost done with the the thesis?
8/8/16, 5:27 PM ~ Alex C~ Hit a little obstacle. Nothing serious just time consuming. Should be done by the end of this month and defending by the middle of Sept
8/8/16, 5:29 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Gotta get the beats right, like Detox
8/8/16, 6:25 PM ~ Sean B~ Ah cool

8/11/16, 3:21 PM ~ Dave Wu~ West village, renting for 2500 schmeckles
8/11/16, 5:06 PM ~ james e mooradian~ That's actually a pretty reasonable price
8/11/16, 5:06 PM ~ james e mooradian~ New York is crazy pricy
8/11/16, 5:06 PM ~ Dave Wu~ yeah seemed about right. places start due that in the city
8/11/16, 5:07 PM ~ Dave Wu~ at*
8/11/16, 5:13 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I don't know how anyone could live in Manhattan without making minimally 100k and eating ez-mac or splitting a broom closet studio with a roomie.

8/11/16, 8:58 PM ~ Alex C~ I'm definitely still in for Labor Day
8/12/16, 1:21 AM ~ Sean B~ Shweeeet
8/12/16, 1:21 AM ~ Sean B~ Been dialing in a new sourdough recipe in preparation

8/18/16, 1:38 PM ~ Dave Wu~ per usual I'll be showing up with a bulge of meats
8/18/16, 1:38 PM ~ Dave Wu~ trying to find a fresh choked heirloom pig from a local farm
8/18/16, 1:44 PM ~ Dave Wu~ We do need a pig, right? I'm assuming a suckling pig should have a large enough cavity for a pineapple.
8/18/16, 1:49 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha
8/18/16, 1:50 PM ~ Sean B~ That will be so epic if you roll up with an entire pig
8/18/16, 1:52 PM ~ Sean B~ https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mZE9fJ-ER0M
8/18/16, 1:53 PM ~ james e mooradian~ You can get those whole pigs with the box used to smoke it
8/18/16, 1:53 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Sort of like a keg but with meat
8/18/16, 2:37 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Well looks like the Berkshire strain of baby pigs are not available at the nearby farm. Only got some lean strain piglets. Good news for them because I won't have to make eye with their eater.
8/18/16, 2:37 PM ~ Dave Wu~ But I can still pick up some OG strain back ribs and loin chops from local meat dealer.
8/18/16, 7:01 PM ~ james e mooradian~ All we would need is a rack of boneless ribs or a pork loin. We don't have to do swineapple btw, it's just something else to bring to the table
8/18/16, 7:01 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I'm just excited to try my burger recipe again

8/19/16, 2:11 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha I have no idea
8/19/16, 2:14 PM ~ Dave Wu~ There's also a noticeable lack of laser beams in the background of what appears to be a school portrait used on the ID.

8/20/16, 1:15 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Cool with me
8/20/16, 1:15 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Dave, would you want to group up at Costco before we head up?
8/20/16, 1:16 PM ~ Sean B~ She said she'll contribute a dish or two.  Maybe a desert and a vegetable
8/20/16, 1:16 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I'm cool with that as well
8/20/16, 1:17 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Was thinking burgers, some sort of steak, and the pig/pineapple turducken
8/20/16, 1:17 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I think I don't think I have to work that day but I could def carpool if you want to do that
8/20/16, 1:17 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Hmm maybe I could leave early depending on how much I have to do
8/20/16, 1:17 PM ~ Sean B~ Maybe we should map out a build order for the weekend like last New Years haha
8/20/16, 1:18 PM ~ james e mooradian~ For Courtney we could try doing some legit veggie burgers
8/20/16, 1:18 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Been trying to dial in a recipe based off of some I've tried in the past
8/20/16, 1:19 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I was thinking burgers for lunch, maybe with some homemade sourdough buns?
8/20/16, 1:19 PM ~ Sean B~ She's not vegetarian FYI unless you just wanna do em for the lulz
8/20/16, 1:19 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Steak/swineapple dinners with that brown boule
8/20/16, 1:19 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Oh nm I thought she was
8/20/16, 1:19 PM ~ james e mooradian~ My b
8/20/16, 1:20 PM ~ Dave Wu~ oh then no need to dial back the meat
8/20/16, 1:20 PM ~ Sean B~ But she has a farmshare right now so she gets a crate full of local veggies every week so we could bring tons of good shit
8/20/16, 1:20 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I could still try. The veggie burgers are as good as any meat burgers I've had in the past
8/20/16, 1:20 PM ~ Sean B~ Kale fennel beets heirloom tomatoes and shit
8/20/16, 1:20 PM ~ james e mooradian~ What kind of veggies does she have access to
8/20/16, 1:20 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Ah
8/20/16, 1:20 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Heirloom tomatoes are where it's at
8/20/16, 1:21 PM ~ james e mooradian~ This season has been shit for mass produced grape/cherry tomatoes
8/20/16, 1:21 PM ~ Sean B~ It's different every week
8/20/16, 1:21 PM ~ Sean B~ So won't know til a couple days before

8/20/16, 1:22 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Or a build order
8/20/16, 1:26 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha not really.  Just been working on perfecting this 50% whole wheat sourdough recipe which is pretty versatile.  Not sure if I wanna do anything additional bc the process is so time consuming
8/20/16, 1:27 PM ~ Sean B~ I'll think about it though.  There's different things you can still do with the same dough
8/20/16, 1:29 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Very true
8/20/16, 1:33 PM ~ Sean B~ Other ppl are welcome to make some as well
8/20/16, 1:37 PM ~ Dave Wu~ my bread baking skills are not up to snuff.
8/20/16, 1:40 PM ~ Sean B~ I'm confident I can keep us supplied with loaves
8/20/16, 1:40 PM ~ Dave Wu~ pinching loaves
8/20/16, 1:45 PM ~ Dave Wu~ that's the type of loaves I'll be making with the amount of food we're consuming
8/20/16, 1:45 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha
8/20/16, 3:06 PM ~ Dave Wu~ There's a police presence at Costco because a group of protestors plan on wearing hazmat suits and dumping blood on themselves in the meat section

8/22/16, 8:09 PM ~ Sean B~ Nope
8/22/16, 8:10 PM ~ Sean B~ Weird that South is probably the shitty dining hall now
8/22/16, 8:10 PM ~ Dave Wu~ kinda like gentrification of dorms
8/22/16, 8:13 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I wonder if there plans to update the alumni dorms
8/22/16, 8:14 PM ~ Alex C~ And McMahon is the best dining hall now. Total flip. And they're tearing down the grad dorms across from the coop. Doesn't look like they're doing anything with alumni
8/22/16, 8:14 PM ~ Dave Wu~ blow down since walls so there's open concept dorm living where everyone can see you wamk it
8/22/16, 8:14 PM ~ Dave Wu~ wank*

8/22/16, 8:15 PM ~ Sean B~ Things done changed
8/22/16, 8:15 PM ~ Dave Wu~ they probably also need a shitty dorm to dump honors kids... Butts toured the facility if I remember correctly
8/22/16, 8:23 PM ~ Dave Wu~ They've improved the place so much that I might be fooled into sending my spawn there in the future.
8/26/16, 3:47 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Having an existential crisis. Who wants pheasant and rack of lamb along with OG oinks?
8/26/16, 6:31 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha wait are you having an existential crisis about the meat selection or wanting to buy meat because of said crisis?
8/26/16, 7:02 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I also am unclear on Dave's statement
8/26/16, 8:33 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I'm buying meat because of said crisis. Sometimes life makes you want to you buy a serious meat spread. Because life.
8/26/16, 11:23 PM ~ Sean B~ Dave bb r u ok?
8/27/16, 11:24 AM ~ Dave Wu~ A family friend was recently murdered. So I've been lost in thoughts about the Sisyphean struggle of life. I'm glad we're all still alive.
8/27/16, 11:27 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Shit Dave, I'm so sorry. It's never easy to deal with news like that
8/27/16, 11:28 AM ~ james e mooradian~ I hope the family is able to cope. I hope you guys are too
8/27/16, 6:40 PM ~ Sean B~ Wow so sorry to hear that.  That's terrible.
8/28/16, 4:51 PM ~ Sean B~ Well I'm looking forward to seeing you all.  Hopefully spending some time together will be positive /helpful for you (via bros 4 life).  I will be sure to bring good vibes
8/28/16, 6:58 PM ~ Alex C~ Yup, it'll be all good vibes and meat sweats
8/29/16, 2:49 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Ah sorry for dropping a real bummer into the chat. But definitely looking forward to this weekend and some good times.
8/29/16, 3:29 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Current my meat list: 2 Berkshire pig back rib racks, 2 pheasants (maybe 3, they're smallish birds), large slab of Berkshire pork butt. May end up be subbing with Angus/dry aged steaks or fresh chickens or whatever distracts me at the meatman shop
8/29/16, 7:45 PM ~ Sean B~ Damn that's quite a build order
8/29/16, 7:45 PM ~ Sean B~ Alex is the wood oven ready for use? If so we should plan to make some kind of pizza or flatbread for one meal
8/29/16, 7:46 PM ~ james e mooradian~ 😮 gonna need to bring some fiber one for this trip
8/29/16, 7:47 PM ~ Dave Wu~ good idea it'll be like dunking a beach ball after these meals
8/29/16, 7:47 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I'm glad you can share with us tho Dave. Always happy to talk with you guys
8/29/16, 7:47 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Let me know if it makes sense for me to bring up stuff separately/split the meat load
8/29/16, 7:48 PM ~ james e mooradian~ It seems like a lot
8/29/16, 7:48 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Never cooked pheasant or pork booty before
8/29/16, 7:49 PM ~ Sean B~ Pork butt is same as pork shoulder, so typically you slow cook it to make pulled pork
8/29/16, 7:50 PM ~ Dave Wu~ yep that's the plan... maybe pulled pork pizza
8/29/16, 7:50 PM ~ Sean B~ 👍
8/29/16, 7:50 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Hoo wee
8/29/16, 7:50 PM ~ Dave Wu~ yeah pheasant not to sure. might just opt for fresh chicken's
8/29/16, 7:51 PM ~ Dave Wu~ 2 of them and try different styles
8/29/16, 7:51 PM ~ Sean B~ See what kind of weird shit we can stuff up their butts
8/29/16, 7:51 PM ~ james e mooradian~ We could do Dutch oven chicken
8/29/16, 7:51 PM ~ Alex C~ The brick oven is operational
8/29/16, 7:53 PM ~ Dave Wu~ we're gonna need some high quality BBQ sauce. Dunno if I should pick up a Costco jug of sweet baby rays
8/29/16, 7:53 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
8/29/16, 7:54 PM ~ Dave Wu~ haha
8/29/16, 7:54 PM ~ Dave Wu~ or if someone has some artisanal smash your grandma BBQ sauce
8/29/16, 7:55 PM ~ Dave Wu~ smack*
8/29/16, 9:44 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Stubbs is really good
8/29/16, 9:45 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I'll end up making a BBQ sauce infused with pork souls during the cooking process though. A good base sauce is useful but not required
8/30/16, 1:07 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Jim, do you want to carpool up to vt?
8/30/16, 1:08 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Sure dave
8/30/16, 1:08 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I'm out of work 5 on Friday

8/31/16, 7:50 AM ~ Dave Wu~ magic school bus
8/31/16, 8:24 AM ~ Sean B~ Fuck yeah
8/31/16, 8:24 AM ~ Sean B~ This is more or less my life game plan
8/31/16, 8:29 AM ~ james e mooradian~ That tiny house, big living?
8/31/16, 8:33 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Always wondered how you'd power something like that. Do they have to find a place to plug into, or do they have some detachable solar power deal
8/31/16, 8:42 AM ~ Sean B~ Not sure, possibly both.  Usually you'd have a generator on board but also the ability to plug in when you go to rest stops and campgrounds
8/31/16, 8:49 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Electricity comes from three solar panels that charge batteries hidden beneath the bus. A 12-volt system powers the LED lighting and appliances, and a 110-volt system runs the outlets. “We use as much power as we want,” Pelletier says. 
8/31/16, 8:49 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Huh. Pretty impressed with that
8/31/16, 8:50 AM ~ Sean B~ Nice
8/31/16, 9:30 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Though I'm still more inclined towards fixed house living (modern plumbing) and to do something like this
8/31/16, 9:30 AM ~ Dave Wu~ https://valhallamovement.com/learn-how-this-family-grows-6000-lbs-of-food-on-just-110th-acre/
8/31/16, 9:30 AM ~ Sean B~ That's pretty awesome too
8/31/16, 9:50 AM ~ Sean B~ There are many paths to the auth life
8/31/16, 9:51 AM ~ Dave Wu~ never go back to the carpet store
8/31/16, 5:51 PM ~ Alex C~ You guys feel like doing a little hike in the woods this weekend like last time?
8/31/16, 5:52 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah definitely
8/31/16, 5:54 PM ~ Alex C~ Nice, I'm going to see if I can find some new trail options to check out
8/31/16, 5:57 PM ~ Sean B~ Cool
8/31/16, 6:10 PM ~ Sean B~ Gotta offset the massive calorie intake
8/31/16, 6:33 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Gotta make my dating profile feel legitimate
8/31/16, 6:34 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Though I get the feeling the need may be ending soon.
8/31/16, 7:47 PM ~ Sean B~ Oh yeah? You been seeing someone?
9/1/16, 10:09 AM ~ Dave Wu~ 😎

9/1/16, 12:05 PM ~ Alex C~ Do you guys have any interest in kayaking? My parents and uncle pay are going either Saturday or Sunday and they said they'd reserve us kayaks too if we wanted to go.
9/1/16, 12:10 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Does the Pope's dick fit through a donut hole?
9/1/16, 12:17 PM ~ james e mooradian~ http://i.imgur.com/NoaPq5N.gif

9/1/16, 3:14 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Ah. Well if the Shatner wants you to watch him negotiate a wank, don't break eye contact.
9/1/16, 3:42 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha
9/1/16, 8:28 PM ~ Sean B~ Alright got the farm veggies, we got: kale, mixed greens, parsley, 1 green bell pepper, 3 jalapeños, 1 large eggplant,  1 cucumber, celery and 1 tomato
9/1/16, 8:28 PM ~ Sean B~ Can probably do a salad and also use some for pizza toppings
9/1/16, 9:05 PM ~ Alex C~ Aahhh sheeeeuuuuttt
9/1/16, 9:09 PM ~ Alex C~ <Media omitted>
9/1/16, 9:10 PM ~ Alex C~ Dang, was trying to record this barred owl that I keep hearing

9/2/16, 9:44 AM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
9/2/16, 10:05 AM ~ Sean B~ Lol nice
9/2/16, 10:06 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Which one are we eating this wknd?
9/2/16, 10:20 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Just a pic from the local farm. Unfortunately I didn't get to look the pig on the eyes. But it's one of these types of oinkers
9/2/16, 10:21 AM ~ Dave Wu~ pretty sure if I got to know the pig personally... we'd be eating vegetables and I'd have a pet pig in my backyard.
9/2/16, 10:22 AM ~ Dave Wu~ so Jim should head down to your place after work? ETA 530
9/2/16, 2:31 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Jim, how are we doing this carpool thing....Need to know... like Marc Anthony

9/2/16, 5:08 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Oh btw are you guys still interested in having steak this wknd? I can head to the co op to see if they have any good meats
9/2/16, 5:09 PM ~ Dave Wu~ damn we really gonna flip the dick down this weekend
9/2/16, 5:10 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I can wait for you, Dave, if you wanna take a look at the potential meats
9/2/16, 5:10 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I'm guessing eta 6 depending on traffic
9/2/16, 5:11 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Also I wan a make sure you have space in your cooler
9/2/16, 5:12 PM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
9/2/16, 5:13 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Awesome
9/2/16, 5:13 PM ~ Alex C~ Haha sweet
9/2/16, 5:13 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I'm gonna grab some ny strip steaks

9/2/16, 5:17 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Just got 5 ny strip steaks

9/2/16, 5:36 PM ~ Sean B~ Can't wait to watch Jim freak that bitch out
9/2/16, 6:43 PM ~ Sean B~ At rob's now bout to head out
9/2/16, 6:43 PM ~ Sean B~ Probably 10:15-10:30 arrival
9/2/16, 7:16 PM ~ Alex C~ Sounds good
9/3/16, 1:29 AM ~ Dave Wu~ btw everyone Chris is getting married today..... meditate in that.....
9/4/16, 9:09 PM ~ james e mooradian~ <Media omitted>
9/5/16, 5:16 PM ~ Alex C~ Thanks for coming up guys! Another successful, meat-filled extravaganza.
9/5/16, 5:17 PM ~ Alex C~ Sean, I think you may have left your preserves. We can mail them to you. Just let me know your address
9/6/16, 8:17 AM ~ Sean B~ Yeah what a rad weekend!
9/6/16, 8:17 AM ~ Sean B~ Ah shit yeah I did forget those
9/6/16, 8:18 AM ~ Sean B~ Maybe I can just wait til the next time I see you.  Shipping those would be kind of a pain

9/7/16, 3:44 PM ~ Dave Wu~ And I'm back.  New phone, other one shit the bucket last night.
9/7/16, 3:47 PM ~ Dave Wu~ All my VT pics are forever encrypted 🙁. Just got the memories.
9/7/16, 3:51 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Nice staff pic. Too bad they didn't add the 'backend developer' bit. Would work well with your sneaky butcher/Baker moniker.
9/7/16, 4:03 PM ~ Sean B~ lol yeah
9/7/16, 5:12 PM ~ Alex C~ Dave, your phone shit the bucket too? The last message I sent on my last phone was in this chat and then it never turned on again. Just got a new phone today
9/7/16, 6:16 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Yeah this is a case of when technology doesn't win.
9/8/16, 9:29 AM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
9/8/16, 9:30 AM ~ Sean B~ Lol I already posted this yesterday my bad
9/8/16, 9:30 AM ~ Sean B~ Guess I subconsciously felt it deserved an encore
9/8/16, 9:32 AM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
9/8/16, 10:22 AM ~ Dave Wu~ 3 loafs at the same damn time
9/8/16, 10:23 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Everytime I see that movie poster, I hear the south park shit movie narrations.

9/8/16, 2:24 PM ~ Alex C~ Hahaha
9/8/16, 2:29 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol nice
9/8/16, 2:30 PM ~ Sean B~ Better ingredients, better sex
9/8/16, 2:37 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Haha that's great

9/8/16, 7:31 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
9/8/16, 7:32 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Dem holes
9/8/16, 7:36 PM ~ Sean B~ First time trying an oval shape loaf. Kinda prefer it over boules.  Way easier to work with
9/8/16, 7:56 PM ~ james e mooradian~ <Media omitted>
9/8/16, 7:57 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Looks amazing
9/8/16, 9:35 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Dude you should totally open a bakery....fluff up the brand via social media, hire cheap the labor, rapidly expand to multiple locations, go public, pump the stocks, and cash out before the business becomes a fiery wreck....you know that simple artisan dream.
9/8/16, 9:35 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol
9/8/16, 9:36 PM ~ Sean B~ I was just crunching some numbers actually.  Making a ton of assumptions but I think it would be possible to clear maybe 50k a year as a one man operation if you could do 100 loaves per day 5 days a week
9/8/16, 9:37 PM ~ Sean B~ Not exactly internet money but you could live
9/8/16, 9:40 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Gotta make it cash only.  Maybe entirely internet based bread order/delivery.  Forgo store front, so you can avoid paying for desirable location.
9/8/16, 9:41 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah that's a good idea
9/8/16, 9:42 PM ~ Sean B~ One person I follow on Instagram does a monthly bread share program similar to a farm share.  60 bucks a month for 2 loaves every week.  That's about $7 per loaf
9/8/16, 9:43 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Wow. Shipping costs must be high. Bread has extremely low shelf life.
9/8/16, 9:44 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Never tried it, but I wonder if vacuum bagging bread increases shelf life
9/8/16, 9:47 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Then again it's a moisture issue. Maybe plan and freeze months of 80% cooked loafs. Then finish them before each shipment. It's 'fresh'
9/8/16, 9:55 PM ~ Dave Wu~ http://qz.com/571151/the-mast-brothers-fooled-the-world-into-buying-crappy-hipster-chocolate-for-10-a-bar/
9/8/16, 10:00 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Just remember that thick beard of yours helps cover up artisanal corner cuts.
9/8/16, 10:30 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol
9/8/16, 10:31 PM ~ Sean B~ It's pick-up only, no delivery
9/8/16, 10:32 PM ~ Sean B~ Shelf life too short for delivery
9/8/16, 10:32 PM ~ Sean B~ Without preservatives you got like 24 hrs basically
9/9/16, 9:11 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Hmm...I guess you could sell frozen half baked loafs with cooking instructions. Then the buyer just needs to complete the baking process for fresh homemade artisan bread. It'll be like is that delivery or Digiorno? Nah, the Sneaky Baker be giving your wife baguettes and boules while you're at work.
9/9/16, 1:10 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah I dunno half baking is a little sketchy
9/9/16, 1:27 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Ain't nothing sketchy about compromising your art so you can improve the reliability of your supply and make mo money.
9/9/16, 1:28 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol I think you're kinda missing the point
9/9/16, 1:31 PM ~ Dave Wu~ It would be difficult to find the right point to stop baking and flash freeze. Like a sweet spot that preserves moisture and structure.
9/9/16, 1:32 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Also doesn't get the health inspector to straight up murder you with fines
9/9/16, 9:11 PM ~ Sean B~ Guess I'm not the only sneaky baker around  https://instagram.com/p/BAmbzFTSDW-/
9/9/16, 9:12 PM ~ Dave Wu~ There can only be one...

9/10/16, 10:10 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Off*
9/10/16, 10:11 AM ~ Sean B~ For that amount of money they better
9/10/16, 12:54 PM ~ Dave Wu~ RI seafood festival for permits for the keystone XL pipeline.
9/10/16, 4:00 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol why

9/10/16, 10:13 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Date
9/11/16, 1:41 PM ~ Sean B~ Ah
9/11/16, 1:44 PM ~ Sean B~ Just remembered this gem from a few years back and read it to Courtney http://www.celebritynetworth.com/articles/entertainment-articles/the-most-embarrassing-private-jet-flight-of-all-time/?fb_action_ids=10200881266696504&fb_action_types=og.likes
9/11/16, 1:44 PM ~ Sean B~ Such a classic.  The Italian carpenter part makes me die every time
9/11/16, 1:53 PM ~ Dave Wu~ 'I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry'... Makes me think of Bear Grylls vs waterfall.
9/11/16, 1:54 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah
9/11/16, 8:30 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
9/11/16, 8:50 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Ah like cold brew oat meal. Also overnight oats sounds like an urban dictionary words.
9/11/16, 8:50 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha yeah it's pretty much cold brew for oatmeal
9/11/16, 8:51 PM ~ Dave Wu~ 'I brought Jane home and served her a bowl of the ole overnight oats'
9/12/16, 7:21 AM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
9/12/16, 6:22 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Were those dry blueberries or fresh? There's a pretty strong blue hue in the milk.
9/12/16, 6:25 PM ~ Sean B~ Frozen from trader joes but they thaw out over night.  I'd imagine fresh are good too
9/12/16, 6:28 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Ah. Frozen is probably better. More flavors/sugars come out from ruptured berries. Fresh ones would probably need to be muddled a bit.
9/12/16, 6:28 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah good point
9/13/16, 2:17 PM ~ Sean B~ Just had my first complementary 15 min massage at work. #internetmoney
9/13/16, 2:26 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Umm.. Well I just made a cup of watery tea with complimentary break room supplies while staring at the floor and pondering my purpose in life. #notinternetmoneyoffice
9/13/16, 2:30 PM ~ Sean B~ Sorry bro
9/13/16, 2:37 PM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>

9/13/16, 9:24 PM ~ Sean B~ Nope
9/13/16, 9:24 PM ~ Sean B~ I like the sound of that though
9/13/16, 9:35 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Probably a good place to record a black metal album/music video
9/13/16, 9:37 PM ~ Dave Wu~ But I gotta map a trail there. Don't wanna embarrass myself and have to permanently live in the woods.
9/13/16, 10:52 PM ~ Sean B~ Id recommend getting the AllTrails app.  Very useful
9/13/16, 10:52 PM ~ Sean B~ http://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/massachusetts/purgatory-chasm-trail
9/13/16, 10:53 PM ~ Sean B~ Looks like it should be a pushover
9/13/16, 10:55 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Yeah it doesn't look bad.
9/13/16, 10:55 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Ain't no ascutney

9/14/16, 10:40 AM ~ Dave Wu~ What do you do with all the loafs you bake? Seems like you're cranking out at least 1 daily.
9/14/16, 10:44 AM ~ Sean B~ Now that I'm working I only bake once a week, maybe twice.   My mom and Courtney eat a fair portion of it.  Also I usually slice them up and store in freezer so it lasts longer.  Even got some in the freezer at work 😎
9/14/16, 11:12 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Sneaky Baker stashing bread everywhere
9/14/16, 11:12 AM ~ Sean B~ You know it
9/14/16, 11:21 AM ~ Dave Wu~ If there's a full blown kitchen at your work place, you should bake loafs while coding in the backend.
9/14/16, 11:32 AM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha I wish.  No oven unfortunately

9/15/16, 10:55 AM ~ Sean B~ Buildin that personal brand
9/15/16, 11:16 AM ~ Alex C~ Started following you. Some pretty headsy bread talk going down

9/15/16, 3:31 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Hahahaha
9/15/16, 3:32 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Also like how your Instagram highlights the fact that you're 'murican
9/15/16, 3:37 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Sean you should totally accompany each bread pic with a sweet existential metacommentary about what it means to be an artisan breadbaker
9/15/16, 3:39 PM ~ Sean B~ Good idea.  Existential baking
9/15/16, 3:40 PM ~ james e mooradian~ 'does this bread have below average crumbing bcos Somerville has reached peak post-gentrification? What does it mean 2 have 'natural leavening' from yeast outside of a hole foods? Is this yeast becoming 2 mainstem?'
9/15/16, 3:41 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha
9/15/16, 3:41 PM ~ Sean B~ So good
9/15/16, 3:41 PM ~ james e mooradian~ The posts practically write themselves
9/15/16, 3:44 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah you could really have a field day with that
9/15/16, 3:44 PM ~ Sean B~ Prob gonna keep it serious for now though
9/15/16, 3:51 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Keeping it safe for dat Baker networking. Probably a good call

9/20/16, 12:12 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Ah the Varidesk. Been thinking about getting one too. But they don't have one that can hold 3 monitors. Plus it's harder to itch my balls in the standing position with the low cube walls.
9/20/16, 12:12 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol damn you rocking three screens?
9/20/16, 12:15 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Yeah but it's not as awesome as it sounds. Mostly need 3 screens because our software isn't efficients and isn't consolidated. Screens are also relatively small 16 inches... But still takes up a large footprint
9/20/16, 12:16 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Also Nice keyboard too... How's it working so far?
9/20/16, 12:18 PM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>

9/20/16, 12:47 PM ~ Sean B~ Pretty good so far I like it
9/20/16, 2:54 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Might want to invest in some Pbt keycaps too. They wear better than the stock abs plastic.
9/20/16, 3:02 PM ~ Sean B~ Ooo nice
9/20/16, 3:02 PM ~ Sean B~ My boss just gave me props for the keyboard.  Gettin that nerd cred 😎

9/21/16, 4:14 PM ~ Dave Wu~ So I'm a bit behind on the times. But is snap chat like what's hot on the streets?
9/21/16, 4:14 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Because I always thought it was the premier app for sending temporary dick pics.
9/21/16, 4:19 PM ~ Sean B~ I don't use it but Courtney does.  Seems to be more popular with younger demographics
9/21/16, 4:21 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Back in my day we used AIM over 56k dial up.
9/21/16, 4:26 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Some people ask could Jordan still hang with the basketball greats today or were things just different back then.
9/21/16, 4:27 PM ~ Dave Wu~ For me, I wonder if blood ninja could hold his own in the modern social media age. The game done changed.
9/21/16, 4:51 PM ~ james e mooradian~ There's probably a version of blood ninja out there in the Snapchat age
9/21/16, 4:51 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Probably dj Khaled

9/23/16, 9:08 AM ~ Sean B~ Haha wow
9/23/16, 9:09 AM ~ Sean B~ Kinda reminds me of that study Alex found a while back where they were testing psychedelics on different mammals and mistakenly thought dosage scaled linearly and accidentally ODed an elephant
9/23/16, 12:20 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I'm probably going to subconsciously time my pees in the near future
9/23/16, 12:20 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Also, that bee study

9/23/16, 3:36 PM ~ Sean B~ What's the specs on this warlock? What kind of rent you asking?
9/23/16, 3:40 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Goddamn dude that apartment looks way nicer than the one I'm currently living in
9/23/16, 3:40 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Although I do remember what it looked like mid-reno
9/23/16, 3:41 PM ~ james e mooradian~ It's amazing what some nice flooring and solid countertops can do, I guess
9/23/16, 4:10 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I'd say the new Haven place is still better. Floors are flat and it's more roomy.
9/23/16, 4:11 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Probably looking to rent it out for 2000
9/23/16, 4:12 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Which is the average rate in this east Somerville for a 1 bedroom with 700sq ft
9/23/16, 4:12 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Except this is 2 bed that's more tizight.
9/23/16, 4:13 PM ~ Sean B~ Damn 2k for a 1br in east Somerville

9/23/16, 4:15 PM ~ Sean B~ That's retarded
9/23/16, 4:17 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Yeh they could probably hire Tony Eveready to be the spokesperson for these new places.
9/23/16, 4:22 PM ~ Dave Wu~ It's all because of y'all internet money folks.

9/26/16, 8:57 PM ~ Alex C~ I'm not sure I can handle watching it. It's too embarrassing
9/26/16, 8:57 PM ~ Sean B~ Like how is this actually happening
9/26/16, 8:58 PM ~ Sean B~ Is this interdimensional cable for a dimension where two actual turd sandwiches are finalists for the presidency
9/26/16, 8:59 PM ~ Alex C~ Haha 'hey Morty, this must be the timeline where everyone went fucking crazy'

9/26/16, 9:20 PM ~ Alex C~ Trump makes no sense. Hillary at least looks like she has a plan, even though she is definitely pandering
9/26/16, 9:26 PM ~ Dave Wu~ This reminds me of the scene in step brothers with the really long fart at the job interview.
9/26/16, 9:34 PM ~ Dave Wu~ 💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩
9/26/16, 10:42 PM ~ Sean B~ That was pure agony
9/26/16, 10:43 PM ~ Alex C~ Horrible
9/26/16, 10:50 PM ~ Sean B~ I just wish she had better charisma.   He's pushing her around and you know people are eating it up even though nothing he says is factual or makes any sense
9/26/16, 10:52 PM ~ Alex C~ Yeah, I was thinking along similar lines. Not very hopeful
9/26/16, 10:52 PM ~ Sean B~ Nope.  She's gonna have to step it up big time
9/27/16, 10:38 AM ~ james e mooradian~ <Media omitted>
9/27/16, 10:41 AM ~ Sean B~ Lol
9/27/16, 11:53 AM ~ Dave Wu~ When the financial advisor asked about my goals, I kinda wanted to respond with 'to crush my enemies, see them driven before me, and hear the lamentations of their women'
9/27/16, 11:54 AM ~ Sean B~ LOL
9/27/16, 11:54 AM ~ Alex C~ Hahaha that would have been perfect
9/27/16, 11:55 AM ~ Sean B~ Just imagining that
9/27/16, 12:15 PM ~ Sean B~ You getting advice on how to diversify your bonds?
9/27/16, 12:20 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Lol yeah. My parents insisted I visit the fidelity office. Learned about some LLC strategies and the 'backdoor Roth'
9/27/16, 12:21 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Had to really stop myself from laughing at the name.
9/27/16, 12:21 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol
9/27/16, 12:22 PM ~ Sean B~ I'd recommend watching the recent John Oliver special on financial advisors before you pick one.  Lots of deception and conflicts of interest in that industry
9/27/16, 12:30 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Yeah I'll have to take a look at that
9/27/16, 12:31 PM ~ Dave Wu~ For now ask the advice is relatively simple. No shamwow sales pitches.
9/27/16, 12:31 PM ~ Dave Wu~ All*
9/27/16, 12:33 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Just the fact that you're at a financial advisor blows my mind. We're old ass adults
9/27/16, 12:33 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Also it's probably a really good idea
9/27/16, 12:38 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah that's some next level adult shit
9/27/16, 12:42 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Definitely felt surreal. Not sure about this whole adulting thing. Shit, I flying towards my 30s and I'm still looking innuendos in finance terms.
9/27/16, 12:42 PM ~ Dave Wu~ For*
9/27/16, 12:43 PM ~ Dave Wu~ 'don't wanna grow up, wanna be a toys r us kid'

9/28/16, 8:23 PM ~ Alex C~ 'Kuh kuh kuh kuh khaattmmaaanndduuu' - my favorite lyric from that one
9/28/16, 8:26 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Probably slip a little pants meet shit in for funsies
9/28/16, 8:28 PM ~ Alex C~ You could always do Napalm Death's U Suffer. If you slip that in, she won't even be fully sure that a song was actually played
9/28/16, 8:53 PM ~ Sean B~ Not sure if iTunes broken or just napalm death

9/29/16, 7:24 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha love it
9/29/16, 8:09 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Was thinking isn't the concern of music artists not being paid enough related to supply and demand. Recording equipment and computer software is so accessible that countless bedroom musicians have sprung up. The market is overwhelmingly flooded with producers and there products. Also there are a multitude of distribution methods (traditional physical copies, YouTube, SoundCloud, Bandcamp, torrent sites, Spotify). When supply is tipped to such extreme, prices would approach zero. Just find the situation to be basically individuals refusing to adapt to the changing market and acknowledge the game done changed.
9/29/16, 8:15 PM ~ Dave Wu~ So music track themselves really are worth $0.0001a play or approaching free via pirating. And the artist doesn't make tracks to profit directly. But instead creates tracks/songs to grow their brand, which is then leveraged for profit via shows, endorsements, etc.
9/29/16, 8:19 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Just my musings with caffeine coursing through me. Maybe, Sean, as a someone with commercial releases and interactions with smaller artists could provide an opinion.
9/29/16, 8:25 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I've often thought about the revenue model for music streaming sites. With things like YouTube or Pandora/Spotify with advertisements, ad revenue can be directly tied to an individual artist's popularity. With a paid streaming service, it's that much more of an indirect correlation between popularity and sales, and you don't get a feel of an individual fan's willingness to  pay for additional goods/services/ad products. Seems like individual artists with a significant amount of fans (like Beyonce and Kanye with that whole tidal thing) can hold sway over the market
9/29/16, 8:26 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I personally still like the band camp/ad supported method of selling IP
9/29/16, 9:42 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah I dunno I don't really know whether it's harder or easier for artists to earn a living today.  Probably easier than 10 years ago at least when distributors hadn't caught up to the technology yet.
9/29/16, 9:44 PM ~ Sean B~ It gets complicated whenever a small number of ppl control distribution of something though because they can basically drive the price down by being the only means of getting your product sold.  So hard to say whether a stream is really 'worth' what an artist is paid for it
9/29/16, 9:45 PM ~ Sean B~ Depends on what your beliefs are about Capitalism, the one True God of America
9/30/16, 10:14 AM ~ Sean B~ FYI new tycho album just dropped
9/30/16, 10:15 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Aw shit
9/30/16, 10:15 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Bout to make those guys like $0.02
9/30/16, 10:28 AM ~ Sean B~ Man this is some next level shit.  Loving it

10/4/16, 12:54 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I flipped through the playlist for the genre...I guess vapor twitch is what I refer to as melodic trap music

10/4/16, 6:44 PM ~ Sean B~ 50k for and additional 2 months of life?  Shit ain't cheap
10/4/16, 6:52 PM ~ Dave Wu~ And usually when you reach the point for this med.... Those won't be 2 pleasant months either.
10/4/16, 6:52 PM ~ Sean B~ Seems like a bad investment
10/4/16, 7:07 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Wow. 'more moments' wasn't even a fun tagline; it was a literal description of the drug's benefit
10/4/16, 7:26 PM ~ Dave Wu~ More moments.... Spent in pain and worrying about impending doom.
10/4/16, 7:35 PM ~ Dave Wu~ As Missy Elliott would say 'Is it worth it?'
10/4/16, 8:27 PM ~ Sean B~ Cashing in on the universal human fear of mortality.  Dark.
10/4/16, 10:12 PM ~ Dave Wu~ That's why there's people like me who use rules and regs backed by the gov to tamp down those notions of life at all costs.
10/6/16, 8:42 PM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
10/6/16, 9:08 PM ~ Sean B~ Say dude, where is your car?
10/6/16, 9:24 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Alex, any idea what the hell is going on up at UConn? http://www.cbsnews.com/news/no-clowning-around-police-clown-threats-hoaxes/
10/6/16, 9:25 PM ~ Alex C~ http://patch.com/connecticut/mansfield/scary-clown-rumors-send-uconn-students-cemetery-streets-hockey-sticks-golf-clu
10/6/16, 9:26 PM ~ Alex C~ Apparently UConn students are fixing to take matters in their own hands
10/6/16, 9:27 PM ~ Alex C~ The second article made me laugh because they use the word fracas to describe the clown hunt on Monday
10/6/16, 9:29 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I feel like I missed some big national trend. Really feeling like a child wandering into the middle of a movie
10/6/16, 9:37 PM ~ Alex C~ I kind of feel bad for clowns.
10/7/16, 12:02 AM ~ Dave Wu~ New meaning to getting clowned on.
10/7/16, 10:19 AM ~ Sean B~ Has the whole world gone crazy? Am I the only one who gives a shit about the rules?
10/7/16, 10:55 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
10/9/16, 9:57 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
10/9/16, 9:58 PM ~ Alex C~ Ah fuckin' multiple
10/9/16, 10:04 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
10/9/16, 10:04 PM ~ Alex C~ Haha
10/10/16, 12:03 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
10/10/16, 12:49 PM ~ Alex C~ Ahhh boooyyyaahhhh
10/10/16, 1:09 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Do I see some additional grains and/or veggies in that loaf?
10/10/16, 1:17 PM ~ Sean B~ Sweet potato 😎
10/10/16, 3:03 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Goddamn he's a madman
10/10/16, 3:03 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Sounds pretty damn good
10/10/16, 5:58 PM ~ Sean B~ Can't stop won't stop
10/11/16, 10:45 AM ~ james e mooradian~ So there's a Twitter account that's just a neural network trained with nothing but trump transcripts
10/11/16, 10:45 AM ~ james e mooradian~ https://mobile.twitter.com/deepdrumpf
10/11/16, 10:46 AM ~ Sean B~ That's incredible
10/11/16, 10:47 AM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
10/11/16, 10:47 AM ~ Sean B~ DeepDream is the stuff of nightmares
10/11/16, 10:48 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Especially when you toss Trump into it.
10/11/16, 10:48 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Looks like emperor palpatine
10/11/16, 10:49 AM ~ james e mooradian~ He's got the illuminati eye on the back of his head. Seems pretty legit
10/11/16, 1:22 PM ~ Dave Wu~ And I totally missed all the bread porn. Looks like you took the bread game to 11.
10/11/16, 1:23 PM ~ Dave Wu~ sweet potato... Game done changed
10/11/16, 1:25 PM ~ Sean B~ It's 1 more delicious
10/12/16, 10:08 AM ~ Dave Wu~ All these voice assist devices from tech companies.... Looking forward to being able to yell out 'play that nuts coming out of the ass sound' and every room reverberates as the foomp sound blasts out a house-wide speaker system. The future is exciting.
10/12/16, 10:09 AM ~ Dave Wu~ I could also see voice assist changing the game for online porn searches.
10/13/16, 8:07 PM ~ Dave Wu~ scoutsomerville.com/oat-shop-davis-square/
10/13/16, 8:08 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Artisanal oatmeal.....
10/13/16, 8:10 PM ~ Alex C~ Love the quote, 'my horse would LOVE this!' Haha, just saw the voice assist post too. Hilarious.
10/13/16, 8:10 PM ~ Sean B~ I'm sold.  Sounds delicious
10/13/16, 8:11 PM ~ Sean B~ Haters gonna hate
10/13/16, 8:26 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Yeah I gotta admit I'm intrigued. Some of the flavor blends sound dope. Though the health conscious part is a bit false, most of the options will probably be loaded with fat and sugar unless you get stock oatmeal.
10/13/16, 8:29 PM ~ Dave Wu~ But you gotta give the people what they want. Like that UConn student union salad place that masqueraded as a healthy option. Or people just assumed plants equates healthy even if it's floating in a bucket of ranch dressing.
10/13/16, 8:33 PM ~ Sean B~ Isn't oatmeal big in Germany?  Over the summer in Canada this German guy came into a cafe and tried to order oatmeal and was very disappointed when they said they didn't have any
10/13/16, 8:41 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Some form of porridge is big in every culture. But I think we shy away from it nowadays because of modern package breakfast foods. It would be cool if someone opened a multi ethnic porridge shop.
10/13/16, 8:42 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah I'm into it
10/13/16, 8:42 PM ~ Sean B~ Bagels and breakfast sandwiches are great but it gets a little old
10/14/16, 10:19 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Hey Sean amongst your tech coworkers how many own condos in the Boston area? Or Alex dunno if you know if the majority of your sister's coworkers own in the Boston area?
10/14/16, 10:20 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Reason I ask is because my street had a recent jump in sales with a bunch of places gutted and condo converted.
10/14/16, 10:21 AM ~ Sean B~ I'm not sure.  My team is on the older side.  The two guys close to my age both rent.  Everyone else owns homes in the burbs.
10/14/16, 10:25 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Hmm... I'm trying to figure out who are the folks buying up multi family condo converts.
10/14/16, 10:27 AM ~ Dave Wu~ May have to do the same on my place. Cash out while the economy is at peak before the cycle begins down swing/recession
10/14/16, 10:28 AM ~ Sean B~ Yeah I dunno.  Probably a tough call.  Seems like property values could climb way higher as gentrification expands into east Somerville
10/14/16, 10:30 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Yeah in planning on holding at least another 1.5 years. When the sales on my street and the neighboring streets go through I'll probably dump it.
10/14/16, 10:31 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Then again o need to access how resilient prices in the area were during the last recession
10/14/16, 10:31 AM ~ Sean B~ Give er the ol 'pump n dump'
10/14/16, 10:31 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Yep
10/14/16, 10:54 AM ~ Alex C~ I think the same thing is happening in South Boston where my sister lives. Especially near her condo there are a number of newly converted and new build condos. Just walking around the neighborhood, you'll see a lot of people who are our age with young kids who most likely work in the seaport. Kelly has said that she knows a number of people at her work who also live in south Boston. So it could be a bunch of 'Kellys' buying up condos in Somerville
10/14/16, 11:04 AM ~ james e mooradian~ http://gis.vgsi.com/somervillema/Search.aspx
10/14/16, 11:05 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Get at that property data from a semi objective source bro
10/14/16, 11:06 AM ~ james e mooradian~ It won't tell you some of the why behind the sales but you can see larger trends if you cast a wide net
10/14/16, 11:07 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Yep. I'm running all the addresses on my street. Thanks
10/14/16, 11:08 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Np
10/14/16, 11:09 AM ~ james e mooradian~ You can search the street without the number as well. I tried a blank search and it just dumped out all the records in the database
10/14/16, 11:09 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Ooooo weeee
10/14/16, 11:10 AM ~ james e mooradian~ You want I should build a web crawler to scoop up all that sweet, sweet property dat
10/14/16, 11:10 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Data?*
10/14/16, 11:11 AM ~ james e mooradian~ I've been looking for projects to add to my portfolio that are sorta unique
10/14/16, 11:18 AM ~ Dave Wu~ That's be awesome... Game done changed
10/14/16, 11:21 AM ~ Sean B~ Nice
10/14/16, 11:27 AM ~ Sean B~ Wow so my old building is worth just shy of 1 mil.  They bought it in 1984 for $80k
10/14/16, 11:31 AM ~ Sean B~ Also lol @ 'bunch of Kelly's'
10/14/16, 11:42 AM ~ Dave Wu~ I'm just imagining Kelly taking over Somerville lol. Driving hard bargains.
10/14/16, 12:39 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I think we let our powers combine, then captain planet.
10/14/16, 12:40 PM ~ Dave Wu~ ...I think if we combined our know how we could make a mark in real estate
10/14/16, 12:42 PM ~ Alex C~ I don't doubt it haha
10/14/16, 12:44 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Also I think if Sean's old building condo'ed out it could easily 1.4 million. Four unit multi in Somerville is slow ramp for investors
10/14/16, 12:44 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Be*
10/14/16, 2:08 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Cruising up Connecticut River. Lots of massive mansions and other structures built by some powerful people from back in the day. Now their names are largely forgotten. That ozymandias fate.
10/15/16, 11:17 AM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
10/15/16, 11:35 AM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha can confirm
10/15/16, 11:35 AM ~ Sean B~ As someone who used to WFH daily
10/15/16, 11:36 AM ~ Sean B~ Nothin like gettin paid to beat your meat
10/15/16, 11:39 AM ~ Dave Wu~ 🎶 Beat my meat like it owes me money. 🎶
10/15/16, 12:01 PM ~ james e mooradian~ <Media omitted>
10/15/16, 12:02 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol
10/15/16, 12:02 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
10/15/16, 1:37 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Seems like they take a really hands on approach to stopping masturbation
10/15/16, 1:37 PM ~ james e mooradian~ 👉👉
10/15/16, 4:27 PM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
10/15/16, 4:28 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Didn't think the bar could go any lower
10/15/16, 4:32 PM ~ james e mooradian~ We need James Cameron
10/15/16, 4:50 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Also, the R Kelly 'Is you tweaking?' line comes to mind. But in the sniveling Trump voice.
10/16/16, 1:25 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah trump has really fucked up the GOP.   Even Glenn Beck has started telling people to vote for Hillary.  Kind of amusing to watch the chaos ensue
10/16/16, 3:36 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Interesting zoning in Hartford. Next to the whole spectrum of car dealerships, there's also a cluster of strip clubs, sex shops, and cheap motels.
10/16/16, 9:12 PM ~ Sean B~ Great place to raise a family
10/16/16, 9:29 PM ~ Dave Wu~ More like great place to get away from the family
10/17/16, 12:22 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Well it looks like I'm getting a Toyota Camry. Really enhances my personal brand...'Bitch, I get 33 m-p-g... That's like a $300 annual savings. I could take you out for a few moderately priced dinners or add that to my Roth'
10/17/16, 12:26 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Is your accord getting up there in mileage?
10/17/16, 12:27 PM ~ Alex C~ Hahaha 'add to my roth'
10/17/16, 12:28 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Not quite. There's a motor oil burn problem. It's kinda of a problem fit this generation of accord. And I'm out of the warranty years and mileage limit. So probably best to trade it in while there's still value and avoid potential engine repair work.
10/17/16, 12:29 PM ~ Dave Wu~ For*
10/17/16, 12:30 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Eh makes sense. A lot of cars with moderate to high mileage have that issue. You could check the (ass) gaskets to see if you have a good seal still. Otherwise yeah you either trade it in or add some oil every couple weeks
10/17/16, 12:30 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Haha ass gaskets.
10/17/16, 12:33 PM ~ Dave Wu~ But yeah the piston ass gaskets are the origin of the problem. Plus my car is up for a new set of tires and there's also a defect causing premature rear break wear.  I just don't see this car being designed to hit 200k like the usual expectation of Hondas
10/17/16, 12:35 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Well neither of those problems are bad enough to end a cars life on their own
10/17/16, 12:35 PM ~ james e mooradian~ More like car AIDS - the resulting complications will destroy the car if not properly managed
10/17/16, 1:52 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Yeah definitely car AIDS. Brakes are tolerable, but the engine bit is unacceptable. There's been a lawsuits over the issue already. Don't really got that kind of time to take the car to the dealer for major servicing and possibly forking out serious dosh for a bandaid solution.
10/17/16, 2:04 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Btw, Sean when you got your rav4 in MA, did you pay the sales tax and excise tax in the same year?
10/17/16, 2:05 PM ~ Sean B~ I think the excise tax was prorated, so I paid for the remaining part of the year
10/17/16, 2:14 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Ah. And from what I'm reading excise tax is used in lieu of individual town prop tax like in CT but fixed to a 2.5% rate, right?
10/17/16, 2:15 PM ~ Sean B~ As far as I know the excise is the only tax you pay on the vehicle other than sales tax
10/17/16, 5:35 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Hmm there's much to weigh... Wish I lived in the city and could get rid of the car.
10/17/16, 10:26 PM ~ Dave Wu~ https://open.spotify.com/album/0PV4prUWnHkJ1EtwkCZVAB
10/17/16, 10:36 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Album is all over the place with genre influences but in a good way like frantic ball fondling.
10/18/16, 6:51 PM ~ Dave Wu~ So tableau hot shit for you data magician types? Like for making snazzy reports and slapping the big data dick on lay folks like me?
10/18/16, 6:51 PM ~ Dave Wu~ So is*
10/18/16, 7:03 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Companies hiring seem to like it. Shits expensive as fuck tho so I wouldn't know
10/18/16, 7:03 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I mostly use excel and shiny
10/18/16, 7:05 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Oh. The new company claims processing software will be delivering me reports made from tableau.
10/18/16, 7:07 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I watched the see it in action vid on their webpage. Looked super cool according to the twenty- something working on a Mac and making reports for a indie coffee roaster
10/18/16, 7:09 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Tableau seems decent from what I've seen. Good visualization software but it's mostly fancy formatting and polish IMO. Best used for report graphics and presentation slides you can point at while the boardroom applauds
10/18/16, 7:11 PM ~ Dave Wu~ So it's that high quality lube for the big data dick
10/18/16, 7:16 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Though you don't need lubed up data to show tablea's lackluster stock price after a hyped NYSE listing.
10/19/16, 9:29 PM ~ Dave Wu~ 'Bigly'
10/19/16, 9:30 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Haha I was wondering if he actually said that
10/19/16, 9:30 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I was giving him the benefit of the doubt thinking I just misheard big-league
10/19/16, 9:32 PM ~ james e mooradian~ You're the puppet.
10/19/16, 9:32 PM ~ Dave Wu~ There's a whole debate about it, but I'm pretty sure it's bigly
10/19/16, 9:32 PM ~ Sean B~ You guys watching?  I gave up after the first debate
10/19/16, 9:33 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I guess it could be used as an adverb, but it's practically never used so it's just jarring.
10/19/16, 9:34 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Yeah still watching the shit show.
10/19/16, 9:35 PM ~ Alex C~ It's painful, but I'm still watching
10/19/16, 9:35 PM ~ Dave Wu~ It's like swap.avi. So awful but you can take your eyes off it.
10/19/16, 9:36 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Can't*
10/19/16, 9:38 PM ~ Alex C~ I just tapped out. Can't stand it anymore
10/19/16, 9:39 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah last time I watched I ended up drinking an entire bottle of wine unintentionally
10/19/16, 9:39 PM ~ Sean B~ Just not worth the trauma
10/19/16, 9:39 PM ~ james e mooradian~ This poor moderator is way too passive to keep this debate on the rails
10/19/16, 9:41 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
10/19/16, 9:47 PM ~ Dave Wu~ It's bad when listening to these two debate makes you yearn to hear Bush stumble through a speech.
10/19/16, 9:49 PM ~ Sean B~ I know
10/19/16, 10:12 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Umm
10/19/16, 10:12 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Did trump just imply that he plans to stage a coup if he loses the election?
10/19/16, 10:20 PM ~ Dave Wu~ 'Have you seen it, have you seen it!'
10/19/16, 11:03 PM ~ Alex C~ God, I really hope there's no violence because of that idiot
10/21/16, 11:12 AM ~ Sean B~ Accurate summary of workin at the business factory  https://mobile.twitter.com/iamdevloper/status/789234931599835136/video/1
10/21/16, 11:19 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Yep, that heat death of the universe really kills most projects.
10/21/16, 11:21 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Also reminds me of 'on a long enough timeline, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero'
10/21/16, 11:26 AM ~ Sean B~ Yeah.  Also the 'like a boss' lonely island video.
10/21/16, 11:28 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Lol so great
10/21/16, 11:28 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Truly this is every work project involving more than 3 ppl
10/21/16, 11:29 AM ~ james e mooradian~ #relateable
10/21/16, 11:32 AM ~ Sean B~ 'Gaze out the window at the happy people.  Wish you were like them.  Considering opening a bar.'
10/21/16, 11:35 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Replace bar with artisan bakery?
10/21/16, 11:35 AM ~ Sean B~ Exactly.
10/21/16, 12:16 PM ~ Dave Wu~ And now my office is trying to figure out costumes for Halloween.... Sounds like a WFH day for me.
10/21/16, 12:17 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol.  At kayak people are bringing their kids to trick or treat at the office.... 😞
10/21/16, 12:18 PM ~ Dave Wu~ You should keep a plastic jack-o'-lantern full of real life advice
10/21/16, 12:18 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol
10/21/16, 12:19 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Also that means most of your office is full of young parents.
10/21/16, 12:19 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Interesting demographics
10/21/16, 12:19 PM ~ Sean B~ The concord office is
10/21/16, 12:20 PM ~ Sean B~ Cambridge is younger
10/21/16, 12:21 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Ah the create two kids and realize your city condo is too small so you trade up to the burbs situation.
10/21/16, 12:22 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Life?
10/21/16, 12:22 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah.  Everyone in concord talks about maintaining their lawns and houses and caring for children.  Pretty riveting stuff
10/21/16, 12:23 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I've always wondered if people actually talked at length about lawn maintenance or if it's just another 'this weather, huh?' Kinda thing
10/21/16, 12:23 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Like there's no way people get *that* into lawn care, right?
10/21/16, 12:23 PM ~ Sean B~ One of my coworkers legit started a sentence during lunch with 'so on Sunday I was thatching my lawn...'
10/21/16, 12:24 PM ~ Sean B~ Wanted to be like 'that sounds awful'
10/21/16, 12:24 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lmao
10/21/16, 12:24 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I guess it's like how we casually quote booyah
10/21/16, 12:24 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Haha
10/21/16, 12:24 PM ~ james e mooradian~ 'so on Saturday I was single-man dping this hoe'
10/21/16, 12:25 PM ~ james e mooradian~ What is thatching btw
10/21/16, 12:25 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I imagine it's like putting up cover so your grass doesn't get too much sun
10/21/16, 12:25 PM ~ james e mooradian~ But idk
10/21/16, 12:25 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
10/21/16, 12:26 PM ~ Sean B~ It's like removing the dead parts I think
10/21/16, 12:26 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I think it's when you go through with a stiff rake and remove dead roots
10/21/16, 12:26 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Yeah that
10/21/16, 12:26 PM ~ Sean B~ And then you hang yourself in the garage
10/21/16, 12:26 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Haha
10/21/16, 12:26 PM ~ james e mooradian~ <Media omitted>
10/21/16, 12:26 PM ~ Sean B~ You know, just a nice little Sunday
10/21/16, 12:28 PM ~ Dave Wu~ It's pretty sad that lawn care actually dominates the majority of weekends in suburban life
10/21/16, 12:28 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I think I'm cool with owning an apartment
10/21/16, 12:29 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Like it's not even a joke. Really like the movement to turn lawns into farm space
10/21/16, 12:29 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah what a waste of time and energy
10/21/16, 12:30 PM ~ Sean B~ But I can't imagine if you make decent money and buy something within your means it would be that expensive to pay someone to do it
10/21/16, 12:30 PM ~ james e mooradian~ It really sounds that way. Why spend a significant portion of your life doing something you hate that also doesn't make you money
10/21/16, 12:31 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Maybe
10/21/16, 12:31 PM ~ Sean B~ If your yard is smallish
10/21/16, 12:31 PM ~ james e mooradian~ If you don't care about perfectly manicured lawns you can always get the neighbor kid to mow that fucker for pennies on the dollar
10/21/16, 12:31 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah
10/21/16, 12:32 PM ~ Sean B~ The back yard at Courtney's dads house is pretty cool.  I think it's technically mowed but it's basically moss and natural forest ground.  No fertilizing or watering needed
10/21/16, 12:33 PM ~ james e mooradian~ That's legit
10/21/16, 12:33 PM ~ Sean B~ Just let nature do her thang
10/21/16, 12:33 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I think that's how a lot of American lawns were at one point
10/21/16, 12:33 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Scott's or some similar company paid publicists to shame ppl who had multiple natural types of ground cover
10/21/16, 12:33 PM ~ Dave Wu~ My dad likes mowing the lawn, but I suspect it's so he can put on the sweet ear muffs I bought him and not have to listen to my mom.
10/21/16, 12:34 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lool
10/21/16, 12:34 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I guess everybody needs to have their personal sanctuary
10/21/16, 12:38 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Decades of advertising has ingrained Sisyphean lawn care into our minds. If your lawn ain't perfect, then you're probably poor type mindset.
10/21/16, 12:39 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah such bullshit
10/21/16, 12:40 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Pretty spot on honestly
10/21/16, 12:40 PM ~ james e mooradian~ <Media omitted>
10/21/16, 12:41 PM ~ james e mooradian~ If you're not maintaining your lawn, you're lazy and/or unamerican

10/23/16, 7:48 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
10/24/16, 7:56 AM ~ Alex C~ Dang that looks good
10/24/16, 8:30 AM ~ Sean B~ It is!
10/24/16, 9:13 AM ~ Sean B~ Spelt flour.  #ancientgrains
10/24/16, 3:12 PM ~ Alex C~ Dave, I just saw that a teacher, Mrs. Hayes, from JFK High School in Waterbury, CT won national teacher of the year and got to meet Obama. Did you have her?
10/24/16, 3:40 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I looked at her resume from the teacher of the year submission. Unfortunately I didn't have her as a teacher.  Looks like she started the year I graduated, but taught 9th grade history in my school in a school program.
10/24/16, 3:40 PM ~ Dave Wu~ But that's really epic that a teacher from the ol Brass city won the national award.
10/24/16, 3:41 PM ~ Alex C~ Looks like Waterbury's really becoming quite the place complete with a national teacher of the year and on top of that the timex museum and Jesus land. Woo
10/24/16, 4:20 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Jesus land lol. There's a couple good things in Waterbury. Not much though, not much.
10/24/16, 4:21 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Poster child along with places like Lowell for 19th century industrial cities fallen into decay.
10/24/16, 5:31 PM ~ Sean B~ You should snatch up some of those abandoned mill buildings... Primo converted loft space
10/24/16, 5:32 PM ~ Sean B~ The lofts @ kennys house
10/24/16, 5:40 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Lol most of the mills in the city were torn down in a failed attempt to revitalize in the 90s. Plus taxes are pretty high in the dirty waters. Low cost of entry, high maintenance.
10/24/16, 5:43 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Speaking of mills, I think Apple just set up an office in an old coal plant in Britain. Guess any building from the late 19th to early 20th century is cool.
10/24/16, 5:48 PM ~ Dave Wu~ It's the pink Floyd power plant
10/24/16, 6:34 PM ~ Sean B~ Nothing says hip like the remnants of human exploitation and misery
10/24/16, 6:36 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Can't wait for hip offices to start cropping up in medieval dungeons.
10/24/16, 6:37 PM ~ Sean B~ Actually... Went to a hip restaurant in Czech Republic that was in a former underground dungeon
10/24/16, 6:40 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Wow
10/24/16, 6:40 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I guess no place is safe from hipness.
10/24/16, 6:40 PM ~ james e mooradian~ That's like 2 steps away from the Google concentration campus
10/24/16, 6:41 PM ~ Sean B~ LOL
10/24/16, 6:41 PM ~ Sean B~ Google @ Auschwitz
10/24/16, 6:41 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Haha
10/24/16, 6:41 PM ~ james e mooradian~ ^dark
10/25/16, 12:25 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Well looks like we got a bottled water bandit at the office. #cubelife
10/25/16, 12:29 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Clarification: our supplies ordering person suspects someone is lifting whole cases of water out of the office. But it's not me, my antics are limited kcups and narrow ruled notebooks.
10/25/16, 5:43 PM ~ Alex C~ Just had a math breakthrough. Bout to QED the f outta this dissertation
10/25/16, 5:44 PM ~ Sean B~ QED BITCHESSSS
10/25/16, 5:46 PM ~ Sean B~ https://i.imgur.com/sAvGJPB.gif
10/25/16, 5:47 PM ~ Sean B~ Lemme know when it's done I'll call the Get Wet Girls
10/25/16, 5:56 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Awww shit clowning all over that math hole
10/25/16, 6:03 PM ~ Alex C~ Haha
10/25/16, 6:36 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Aw snap Alex about to release detox.
10/25/16, 7:57 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
10/25/16, 7:58 PM ~ Dave Wu~ The one on the left is a leg roller
10/25/16, 7:59 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Right side... Some screw in the light bulb butt plug
10/25/16, 7:59 PM ~ Alex C~ Both. As Gordon Bombay said, 'Where there's a will, there's a way.... quack, quack, Quack, Quack...'
10/25/16, 7:59 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Anything can be a dildo if you're bold enough
10/25/16, 7:59 PM ~ Alex C~ What are you in pt for?
10/25/16, 7:59 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Yeah imagination
10/25/16, 8:00 PM ~ Sean B~ Here we have the Thing-a-ma-jig, and the French Tickler
10/25/16, 8:01 PM ~ Sean B~ I strained my hip flexor pretty bad from going full-retard with hiking this summer.  Not too fun
10/25/16, 8:01 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Though I remember the thing ama jig being a lot more robust and torture-ey
10/25/16, 8:02 PM ~ Alex C~ Dang, I can imagine that would be painful
10/25/16, 8:06 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Best be careful going from hiking 10 hours a day to sitting 14 hours a day
10/25/16, 8:07 PM ~ Sean B~ I think it was the other direction that did the damage.  But yes true.  They told me sitting too much can delay recovery.  I stand about half the day usually
10/25/16, 8:08 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Nice. Gotta love those standing desk setups
10/25/16, 8:09 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Helps keep you from going from 0 to '55 year old with severe back problems' in 10.8 seconds
10/25/16, 8:11 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah
10/25/16, 8:11 PM ~ Sean B~ One guy at my office does standing yoga poses at his desk.  Not fuckin around.
10/25/16, 8:12 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
10/25/16, 8:16 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lol
10/25/16, 8:17 PM ~ james e mooradian~ 'decision tree'
10/25/16, 8:18 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I've seen a few people at work who do standing desk but sadly no one who takes it to this level
10/25/16, 8:27 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha decision tree that's great
10/25/16, 8:54 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Yeah I need to get a standing desk. Gotta dislocate my hip on the reg to relieve pain.
10/25/16, 8:55 PM ~ Dave Wu~ It's usually my hip that kills me on our VT hikes. I'm like an old grandma.
10/27/16, 10:30 AM ~ Sean B~ Yoga guy is wearing a full beekeeper suit today for office Halloween
10/27/16, 10:47 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Haha nice. Are you costumed up too?
10/27/16, 10:48 AM ~ Sean B~ No I'm not
10/27/16, 10:51 AM ~ Dave Wu~ I'm imagining a bunch of over enthused office folks in costumes and you shaking your head.
10/27/16, 10:52 AM ~ Sean B~ Yeah that's pretty much what's happening
10/27/16, 2:15 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Well I'll gladly wear a Disney princess costume right now and partake in mediocre office Halloween activities. Noticed my office manager and hr manager walk out with an interviewee. Found out they're planning to replace a 3 longtime employees with 1 person.
10/27/16, 2:16 PM ~ Dave Wu~ You either fucking or getting fucked in life.
10/27/16, 2:20 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I think they plan on laying that shit out in time for the holidays
10/27/16, 2:20 PM ~ Sean B~ Dat life doe
10/27/16, 2:20 PM ~ Sean B~ Sorry Timmy no presents for Christmas this year
10/27/16, 2:49 PM ~ Alex C~ https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=DVf88LuHTPo

Yay! Imagination Christmas!
10/27/16, 3:10 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha
10/27/16, 4:00 PM ~ Sean B~ Aw man people are brining their kids in now.  I gotta get out of here
10/27/16, 5:29 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Can't imagine every wanting to bring a child to my workplace or office in general. 'Here's where daddy slowly loses his sanity so you can have nice things'
10/27/16, 5:31 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Maybe you internet office is more fun
10/27/16, 5:31 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah really makes me nostalgic for the days workin for a startup with just a bunch of effing-twenty-somethings chillin hard, listening to bleep bloops, freestyle rapping, committing DUI on motor scooters
10/27/16, 5:37 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Damn getting older is not fun. I just found out my cholesterol is a smidge elevated.
10/27/16, 5:37 PM ~ Dave Wu~ #life
10/27/16, 5:57 PM ~ Sean B~ Eh mines been high since I was a kid.  Prob not worth worrying about.  Might die pulling a carpet off a shelf before that gets you
10/27/16, 6:34 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
10/27/16, 6:42 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Was about to say it would've made a good costume for the your office party...but it could also give off a slight pedo-Kennedy vibe.
10/27/16, 6:42 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha
10/27/16, 7:50 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
10/27/16, 7:50 PM ~ Sean B~ Forgot I had this
10/27/16, 7:53 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Just need to know... Are you drinking wine in the onesie?
10/27/16, 7:56 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha no
10/28/16, 7:12 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Well looks like I might have to deny a med for a kid barely clinging to life. Gonna send it out to a physician reviewer to divvy out the blame/liability. Some heavy stuff for the weekend.
10/28/16, 7:14 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Got the case dropped in my lap right as I was about leave work... Yay
10/28/16, 7:20 PM ~ Sean B~ Jesus
10/28/16, 10:12 PM ~ Sean B~ 'Materials science is pretty cool but magnets is the shit' - overheard at Halloween party just now
10/28/16, 10:13 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Magnets how do they work?
10/28/16, 10:13 PM ~ Alex C~ <Media omitted>
10/28/16, 10:16 PM ~ Dave Wu~ The answer to which is actually very complicated.
10/28/16, 10:17 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Speaking of, have you guys seen the thing on polymagnets?
10/28/16, 10:17 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Gave me such a science boner
10/28/16, 10:17 PM ~ james e mooradian~ https://youtu.be/IANBoybVApQ
10/28/16, 10:17 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Is it like magnets that go both ways?
10/28/16, 10:18 PM ~ james e mooradian~ They go so many ways
10/28/16, 10:19 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Like even dudes who are scientists stop and say 'these fucking magnets, how do they work?'
10/28/16, 10:21 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Had to pause the vid. That kid is bringing back the DH lol.
10/28/16, 10:22 PM ~ Alex C~ Haha you mean 'Garrett with two r's and two t's'
10/28/16, 10:28 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Yeah lol
10/29/16, 12:52 AM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
10/29/16, 12:21 PM ~ Dave Wu~ So auth. Also a hell of a lot more interesting than what I was doing in Somerville last night.
10/29/16, 12:22 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Is it also weird in oddly fascinated by the sewer drain pipe in the background and the whole PVC on iron action.
10/29/16, 12:22 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I'm*
10/29/16, 12:42 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah it was pretty remarkable
10/29/16, 1:07 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Wouldn't be surprised if these guys were jamming out during porch fest this year.
10/29/16, 2:16 PM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
10/29/16, 2:17 PM ~ Sean B~ Damn that looks amazing.  Someday 😄
10/29/16, 2:21 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I'm sure this guy doesn't have to deal with bringing his kids in for an office place trick or treat.
10/29/16, 2:22 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha nope

10/29/16, 3:14 PM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
10/29/16, 4:08 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Someone's going ham sandwich on the trumpet while another is belting out tunes in Spanish/Portuguese. Somerville is quite interesting.
10/29/16, 4:09 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha
10/29/16, 4:19 PM ~ Sean B~ You still working on renovations?
10/29/16, 4:26 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Kinda was here Friday waiting for someone to install a door, but I'm just doing some weekend WFH now before heading back to CT
10/29/16, 4:27 PM ~ Sean B~ Workin hard as usual
10/29/16, 4:34 PM ~ Dave Wu~ That's the only way to WFH.
10/30/16, 12:32 PM ~ james e mooradian~ So someone has been blasting Kenny g for the past 4 hours in my apt complex this morning
10/30/16, 12:33 PM ~ james e mooradian~ All I hear is fucking sad sax while I go about my day
10/30/16, 12:34 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol man you gotta really like Kenny g to blast it so loud that neighbors can hear it
10/30/16, 12:34 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I was jamming to it for the first hour or so
10/30/16, 12:35 PM ~ james e mooradian~ But Kenny g only really gets you so far
10/30/16, 12:36 PM ~ Dave Wu~ One can only take so much of Kenny Jizzle before they break.
10/30/16, 12:38 PM ~ Sean B~ Wonder if they use Kenny G torture down in Guantanamo
10/30/16, 12:40 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I could see it being a thing
10/30/16, 12:41 PM ~ Dave Wu~ We tried waterboarding and he wouldn't break.... Bring in Kenny G
10/30/16, 12:41 PM ~ Sean B~ Would love to see what's actually going on in that person's apartment.  I'm imaging some depraved drug fueled sex orgy
10/30/16, 12:43 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I really wanna imagine whoever is blasting Kenny is just making pancakes
10/30/16, 12:44 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Just like being really inappropriately sensual with the batter n such
10/30/16, 12:44 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha
10/30/16, 12:45 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Maybe that's the secret to making good bread.
10/30/16, 12:55 PM ~ Sean B~ I sometimes listen to rap while making bread.  Maybe I should give ol KG a try
10/30/16, 3:46 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
10/30/16, 6:06 PM ~ Alex C~ Lol, Rick Ross and bread shaping, amazing. Saw the finished loaves on instagram. Lookin damn good
10/30/16, 6:39 PM ~ Sean B~ Just trying to keep it real for all you homies in the struggle
10/30/16, 6:40 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>

10/31/16, 3:44 PM ~ Dave Wu~ What will they think of next? Get a week's worth of nutrition with a quick breakfast shake butt chug!
10/31/16, 4:05 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I also just learned today that water bottle flipping is a popular activity among kids. Guess it's better than having junior huff jenkum.
10/31/16, 4:25 PM ~ Sean B~ Flipping like physically?
10/31/16, 4:26 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Yep like throwing a bottle in the air and flipping it.
10/31/16, 4:28 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Not a metaphor
10/31/16, 4:29 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Feel like an old man because I found out about it through the WSJ.
10/31/16, 4:39 PM ~ Sean B~ Oh boy
10/31/16, 4:40 PM ~ Sean B~ Those zany youths
11/1/16, 3:51 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Whoa, so the person looking to rent a room in my unit is a craft brewer from Canada. Like the guy has legit brew experience.
11/1/16, 3:55 PM ~ Dave Wu~ My attempt to stand up against gentrification in ESom failed. Guess I'll go all out renting out to millennial folk and contribute to the seemingly unstoppable socioeconomic changes in the area.
11/1/16, 4:21 PM ~ Alex C~ Did the guy have his own brewery in Canada? Or was he a beer master at one?
11/1/16, 4:26 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Based on his LinkedIn, he has some brewing experience along with a bunch of brewer operations related experience.
11/1/16, 6:47 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Sign I'm getting old: Can't wait for my Fico score to update in 4 days after paying off my kitchen project financing.
11/1/16, 6:53 PM ~ james e mooradian~ That IRL high score
11/1/16, 7:00 PM ~ Sean B~ The game where even when you win, you still lose
11/1/16, 7:07 PM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
11/3/16, 12:32 PM ~ Sean B~ Just overhead some old guy in the hallway of my office building talking on the phone and he literally said this exact sentence:
11/3/16, 12:32 PM ~ Sean B~ ''You know, it's just like what Obama did.  His administration blatantly discriminated against Christians and he filled his team with all Muslims instead.  And now they have the emails to prove it too.'
11/3/16, 12:32 PM ~ Sean B~ #makeamericagreatagain
11/3/16, 12:39 PM ~ Dave Wu~ So how easy is it to get Canadian citizenship?
11/3/16, 12:40 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Also does that guy work at kayak?
11/3/16, 12:42 PM ~ Sean B~ No he doesn't thank god
11/3/16, 12:46 PM ~ Dave Wu~ That's some interdimensional cable shit right there. Except it's real and it's scary.
11/3/16, 12:49 PM ~ Sean B~ Imagine living life in such a delusional state that you sincerely believed stuff like that to be true.  It kind of makes me slightly sympathetic of the crazy conservative people... Like if I really believed that I would be freaking out too.  I reminds me of when I took CS math and we were studying formal logic and my prof was saying that politics is basically all about just making logical fallacies.  Where you basically promote conclusions that are valid based on a set of premises, but usually people don't question the validity of the premises themselves, or it's difficult to do so.
11/3/16, 12:52 PM ~ Dave Wu~ That's like the bedrock of religion too.
11/3/16, 12:54 PM ~ Sean B~ Yep
11/3/16, 3:11 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Two co-workers at the office trying to decide if they wanna hit up the local bee's or the Chili's. #officespace
11/3/16, 3:13 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Yikes
11/3/16, 3:41 PM ~ Sean B~ Heard the hoes get real nasty down at club Applebee's
11/3/16, 3:42 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Excellent way to get jalapeno poppers and the clap on the same night.
11/3/16, 8:02 PM ~ Sean B~ Just realized Dave and Alex had birthdays last month and I totally dropped the ball.  #badfriend

11/3/16, 8:14 PM ~ james e mooradian~ 🎉🎈 sorry guys
11/3/16, 8:19 PM ~ Alex C~ Haha that comic gets me every time.
11/3/16, 8:24 PM ~ Sean B~ That 3-0 comin up real quick
11/3/16, 8:25 PM ~ Sean B~ That's ok though bc Alex and Dave have basically been 30 years old their whole lives 😂
11/3/16, 8:25 PM ~ Alex C~ Haha exactly. 'No hopes, no dreams, just waiting to die...'
11/3/16, 8:26 PM ~ james e mooradian~ <Media omitted>
11/3/16, 10:06 PM ~ Alex C~ I'm absolutely crushing my dissertation writing while listening to tycho right now. I'd never really listened to them before but I saw them recommended in my Apple Music and remembered you guys talking about them so I gave them a try. Really great stuff to work to.
11/3/16, 10:14 PM ~ Sean B~ Nice!!
11/3/16, 10:14 PM ~ Sean B~ You getting close to done?
11/3/16, 10:14 PM ~ Alex C~ If I can meet two deadlines this week, I should finish before or on Dec 2
11/3/16, 10:15 PM ~ Sean B~ Sheeutt nice
11/3/16, 10:15 PM ~ Sean B~ Can't wait to see those sick ass findings
11/3/16, 10:16 PM ~ Alex C~ <Media omitted>
11/3/16, 10:16 PM ~ Alex C~ Check out this comparison of computation time required for the model I developed versus the standard, finite element analysis, and a comparable simplified model called ECF. All three give roughly the same predictions.
11/3/16, 10:17 PM ~ Alex C~ Pretty arcane stuff, but exciting after years of work
11/3/16, 10:17 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
11/3/16, 10:18 PM ~ Alex C~ My reaction exactly when I first realized how fast my model was
11/3/16, 11:27 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Goddamn 5-6 orders of magnitude over FEA
11/4/16, 7:32 AM ~ Alex C~ Yeah, Jim, you're going to like the network model I made. And 5-6 orders of magnitude is just the solution step. My method also doesn't require meshing, which can take hours. So in total it's literally about a billion times faster
11/4/16, 8:04 AM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
11/4/16, 9:41 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Sean, that's exactly what I was gonna post. That sciencing is so edge that my feeble end-user mind can't comprehend.
11/4/16, 9:43 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Alex, good to see the album is on track for a Dec release. Also happy belated, I forgot too.
11/4/16, 9:43 AM ~ Alex C~ Thanks, Dave! I think I owe you a happy belated birthday too!
11/4/16, 10:27 AM ~ james e mooradian~ I'm excited to see dat release

11/8/16, 12:43 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Sadly Detroit of all places is trending towards gentrification. You can still get some super nice Victorian houses on the cheap, but it probably won't last. The city is being lubed with artists right now. Just waiting for some high paying industries and their yuppie workforce to plunge in balls deep off a step ladder.
11/8/16, 12:50 PM ~ Sean B~ The wheels on the bus go round and round
11/8/16, 12:58 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I guess in the meantime you could open a bakery there. Capitalize on the gritty beard and post-industrial city image. Keep it real by selling loafs for $10 a pop.
11/8/16, 12:59 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Maybe include a cool background story about how you grew up on the mean streets of Detroit and made it out flipping ancient grain loafs.
11/8/16, 5:57 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol
11/8/16, 5:57 PM ~ james e mooradian~ This new Haven voting line is looking pretty intimidating
11/8/16, 5:58 PM ~ Sean B~ Can't believe 08 election was 8 years ago.   Remember waiting in line outside EO smith
11/8/16, 5:58 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Feeling like I shoulda just bought the fastpass
11/8/16, 5:58 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol
11/8/16, 5:58 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Damn that was a long time ago
11/8/16, 5:58 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Haha
11/8/16, 5:58 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Yeah man that was the first time we could vote
11/8/16, 5:58 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Feels like another life
11/8/16, 5:58 PM ~ Sean B~ Also I think that was the time I accidentally voted against same sex marriage in CT
11/8/16, 5:58 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lmao
11/8/16, 5:59 PM ~ Sean B~ Really noobsauced on that one
11/8/16, 5:59 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Same they made it hella confusing
11/8/16, 5:59 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Those lobbyists outside the voting area were pretty sneaky iirc
11/8/16, 6:00 PM ~ Sean B~ Mass might pass recreational Maryjane.  Maybe I'll diversify into artisan hydro dank
11/8/16, 6:01 PM ~ Sean B~ Handcrafted by a bearded guy in plaid
11/8/16, 6:01 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Just baking bread and baking customers all damn day
11/8/16, 6:01 PM ~ Sean B~ Yup
11/8/16, 6:01 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Does ct have any election day bills? I didn't see any online
11/8/16, 6:12 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Bills?
11/8/16, 6:13 PM ~ Sean B~ No ballot measures for CT according to the Google
11/8/16, 6:13 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I guess bills is the wrong word. Ballot issues I guess? Like the same sex marriage thing
11/8/16, 6:13 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Oh that lol
11/8/16, 6:13 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Yeah I was surprised, I thought I missed something
11/8/16, 6:14 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I guess I'll know for sure in an hour or two
11/8/16, 6:14 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I forgot I'm still registered in Storrs.
11/8/16, 6:14 PM ~ james e mooradian~ You should check online tbh
11/8/16, 6:14 PM ~ james e mooradian~ They don't have any info on me
11/8/16, 6:15 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I'm just reregistering on the spot
11/8/16, 6:16 PM ~ Sean B~ Better trek your ass on down to EO smith then
11/8/16, 6:16 PM ~ Sean B~ Maybe grab a froyo at Storrs downtown afterward
11/8/16, 6:17 PM ~ james e mooradian~ http://www.dir.ct.gov/sots/LookUp.aspx
11/8/16, 6:20 PM ~ james e mooradian~ That would tell you if you have any registration info in ct
11/8/16, 6:35 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Guess I'm not registered in Storrs
11/8/16, 6:35 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Not sure where actually.
11/8/16, 6:47 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Dat robust DMV database
11/8/16, 7:12 PM ~ Sean B~ Would love to see what kind of set up they have under the hood.  Gotta be a total nightmare.  Probably one copy of an MS access database on a single machine from 1995
11/8/16, 7:12 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I worked with DMV data during my masters
11/8/16, 7:13 PM ~ james e mooradian~ It's still in punchcard format
11/8/16, 7:13 PM ~ Sean B~ No way
11/8/16, 7:13 PM ~ Dave Wu~ State of the art tech in the mid 20th century
11/8/16, 7:15 PM ~ james e mooradian~ It did have characters as opposed to punching (maybe it's called something different) but it was an A-Z+0-9 thing with a 40 character limit per line
11/8/16, 7:15 PM ~ Sean B~ Wow...
11/8/16, 7:15 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I do believe that is the format of one of the 'newer' punchcsrds
11/8/16, 7:16 PM ~ Sean B~ Tax dollars hard at work
11/8/16, 7:16 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Make the DMV great again
11/8/16, 9:19 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I think the scariest thing coming out of this election is the rise of misguided and illogical populist thought.
11/8/16, 9:20 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
11/8/16, 9:20 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I mean that's nothing new but now it has a horrible, horrible outlet
11/8/16, 9:20 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I'm kinda worried I'm gonna have to start looking for visas
11/8/16, 9:21 PM ~ Sean B~ Courtney's workin on her EU citizenship.  Dat backup plan
11/8/16, 9:21 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I mean if u have any good leads
11/8/16, 9:22 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I could maybe wfh from spain
11/8/16, 9:22 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Yeah definitely not new. Just get the feeling the long stretch of peace and prosperity enjoyed by our parents' generation will be ending within our lifetimes.
11/8/16, 9:23 PM ~ Dave Wu~ But that's the cycle of human history. The stone always rolls back at some point.
11/8/16, 9:24 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lol
11/8/16, 9:24 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I think the eventual hope is that technology will eventually bring about lasting peace
11/8/16, 9:24 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Or wipe us out
11/8/16, 9:24 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I mean either way
11/8/16, 9:25 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Hoping for that AI takeover
11/8/16, 9:25 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Allmother will care for us
11/8/16, 9:25 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Ex machina shank me in the back shit
11/8/16, 9:26 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah just upload me 2 the cloud bro
11/8/16, 9:26 PM ~ Sean B~ Just wanna lay low and chill in the cloud for ever
11/8/16, 9:26 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Fuck yeah
11/8/16, 9:27 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Just open up an artisanal b2b services platform and earn an honest living
11/8/16, 9:29 PM ~ Sean B~ We think New England should secede and become a Canadian Provence.  Canada is mad chill
11/8/16, 9:29 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Lol
11/8/16, 9:30 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I'd be cool with being South Quebec
11/8/16, 9:30 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Their current prez is like our obama
11/8/16, 9:30 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Super chill
11/8/16, 9:31 PM ~ Sean B~ Justin Trudeau!!
11/8/16, 9:32 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Was a huge fan of him in scrubs
11/8/16, 9:33 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Haha yeah he totally looks like him
11/8/16, 9:42 PM ~ Sean B~ Man we need some good news this shit is going south fast
11/8/16, 9:43 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Lol there's a silver lining for me
11/8/16, 9:43 PM ~ james e mooradian~ https://www.google.com/amp/amp.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2016/11/04/donald_trump_s_plan_to_privatize_america_s_roads_and_bridges.html
11/8/16, 9:44 PM ~ james e mooradian~ It seriously fucks over a ton of people but it would make my field significantly more lucrative
11/8/16, 9:45 PM ~ Dave Wu~ You either fucking or getting fucked... Life
11/8/16, 9:47 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Like the rest of his policies, it's not thought through
11/8/16, 9:47 PM ~ james e mooradian~ It would be devastating to income divide
11/8/16, 9:47 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Also trending away from a more I unified healthcare system benefits me.
11/8/16, 9:47 PM ~ Sean B~ It's gonna be uge, bigly
11/8/16, 9:47 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Yeah true
11/8/16, 9:48 PM ~ james e mooradian~ It's the choice between being successful in a world you don't want to live in
11/8/16, 9:48 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Or being less so in a world that that's not as bad
11/8/16, 9:50 PM ~ Dave Wu~ There's also the bit where many others are going through the same dilemma. It only takes one or a few to choose self to muck it up
11/8/16, 9:52 PM ~ Dave Wu~ As Mungo Jerry would say Do what ya feel.
11/8/16, 9:58 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Watching election results with mathbonus playing....a very interesting combo
11/8/16, 9:59 PM ~ Sean B~ Might as well enjoy some auth bleep bloops while the world burns to the ground around us
11/8/16, 10:02 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Mathbonus really knows how to enhance the grim
11/8/16, 10:30 PM ~ Dave Wu~ This is looking bleak.
11/8/16, 10:31 PM ~ Sean B~ Stock market's not lookin good
11/8/16, 10:32 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Shits dropping in Asia.
11/8/16, 10:35 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Wubba lubba dub dub
11/8/16, 10:40 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Good thing I put a ton of money in my 401k
11/8/16, 10:40 PM ~ james e mooradian~ 😭😭
11/8/16, 10:43 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Sort of an aside, but the green party presidential candidate is kind of a badass
11/8/16, 10:44 PM ~ Sean B~ Bout to start stuffing the mattress
11/8/16, 10:44 PM ~ james e mooradian~ It's too bad she doesn't matter, I would totally get behind her if she were a serious contender
11/8/16, 11:12 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Well looks like ol Detroit might be the most important place in the world right now
11/9/16, 7:25 AM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
11/9/16, 7:31 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Guess the only good news is MA legalized weed
11/9/16, 7:33 AM ~ Sean B~ Yep.  At least I can buy a vape and smoke myself into oblivion while the country falls apart
11/9/16, 9:10 AM ~ Sean B~ It's deafeningly quiet in the business factory right now
11/9/16, 9:10 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Same thing here
11/9/16, 9:12 AM ~ Sean B~ Just crazy how wrong the polls and predictions were.  Most people never even considered this was an actual possibility.  I can't even process it
11/9/16, 9:18 AM ~ Sean B~ Aggregated polls had Hillary at 93% win chance less than a week out.  About the same with prediction markets.  It was at around 83% at 8pm last night
11/9/16, 9:18 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Well never underestimate the discontent masses. We are fortunate enough to belong to the more privileged segment of the US population.
11/9/16, 9:18 AM ~ james e mooradian~ I read an article by a guy who was slamming the fivethirtyeight model because it predicted a 35% chance of trump winning
11/9/16, 9:19 AM ~ james e mooradian~ He was not a good statistician but he basically was confused as to why that probablility was so high while huffpost and ny times and other left leaning models had a 99% chance of Hillary winning
11/9/16, 9:20 AM ~ james e mooradian~ I guess Nate silver still knows his shit
11/9/16, 9:20 AM ~ Sean B~ Yeah
11/9/16, 9:20 AM ~ Alex C~ Yeah, he was very cautious all the way.
11/9/16, 9:20 AM ~ Sean B~ That seems to be the takeaway is that she really failed to court the blue collar workers which dems historically won.   Basically their frustration outweighed their reservations about trump's bigotry
11/9/16, 9:20 AM ~ Sean B~ Bernie would have done better in that demographic
11/9/16, 9:21 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Absolutely
11/9/16, 9:21 AM ~ james e mooradian~ <Media omitted>
11/9/16, 9:21 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Yep and back with Obama he had Biden to attract blue collars
11/9/16, 9:21 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Lol
11/9/16, 9:21 AM ~ Sean B~ I don't think all of them could possibly be that ignorant and hateful.  But when you gotta put food on the table that forces you to make certain choices.  Le sigh 😞
11/9/16, 9:22 AM ~ james e mooradian~ I think it's our thinking from a rural perspective
11/9/16, 9:22 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Good thing is we live in a country where we vote and choose someone and that's it.
11/9/16, 9:22 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Nobody has given a shit about people outside cities, most of all hillary
11/9/16, 9:22 AM ~ Dave Wu~ There's not post election brawl.... Factions literally shooting each other
11/9/16, 9:23 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Trump won't help them but he will hurt urban areas for sure
11/9/16, 9:23 AM ~ Alex C~ Agreed, I saw this report on rural healthcare last week and I really began to understand why there are so many people angry enough to vote for trump https://youtu.be/LzPCEgc7s_s
11/9/16, 9:24 AM ~ Sean B~ Yeah... Silver lining is this is going to force both parties to really reevaluate shit and hopefully we'll get much better candidates next time around
11/9/16, 9:24 AM ~ james e mooradian~ He's like the Martin shkreli of politics
11/9/16, 9:24 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Hopefully pisses enough people off to make a change
11/9/16, 9:25 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Hopefully.
11/9/16, 9:25 AM ~ Alex C~ And if Trump tweets us into nuclear war, the ensuring nuclear winter will not only halt global warming but will also reduce the population problem. Always look on the bright side
11/9/16, 9:25 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Legit
11/9/16, 9:25 AM ~ james e mooradian~ He might befriend Putin in the end
11/9/16, 9:26 AM ~ james e mooradian~ They're like kindred spirits
11/9/16, 9:26 AM ~ Sean B~ Haha good point.  As bill burr said 'lanes just opening up on the highway!'
11/9/16, 9:26 AM ~ Alex C~ We can all go to the Super Bowl!
11/9/16, 9:26 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Woo
11/9/16, 9:26 AM ~ Sean B~ You can drive a tank to work.  Shoot a bald eagle in the face, ah there's plenty of em
11/9/16, 9:27 AM ~ Alex C~ Hahaha
11/9/16, 9:28 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Lol
11/9/16, 9:45 AM ~ Sean B~ Well at least gay marriage was already legalized so that can't get taken away.  Feel really bad for Courtney though bc she works in reproductive health and her whole company could basically get defunded
11/9/16, 9:46 AM ~ Sean B~ Just feel bad for women in general
11/9/16, 9:46 AM ~ james e mooradian~ I thought trump also promised he would try to repeal same sex marriage
11/9/16, 9:47 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Seriously though womens rights are going to be set back another decade or teo
11/9/16, 9:48 AM ~ Sean B~ Is that even repeal-able at this point?  I can't imagine he really opposes it. He's not religious
11/9/16, 9:48 AM ~ Dave Wu~ I hope he doesn't roll back progressive gains, we'd be back to 1900.
11/9/16, 9:49 AM ~ Dave Wu~ I doubt you can repeal. It's already been supported by the supreme Court
11/9/16, 9:49 AM ~ Sean B~ Kinda assumed that stance was just to get votes
11/9/16, 9:49 AM ~ Alex C~ I feel like we need to bubble wrap Ruth bader Ginsburg and assign a doctor to check on her daily. Same for the other old liberal leaning judges
11/9/16, 9:50 AM ~ james e mooradian~ We could easily slide back if the supreme Court gets stacked with old Republican guys
11/9/16, 9:50 AM ~ Dave Wu~ If I remember from civics, the only way to override that is to shift the foundation of the supreme Court by pushing a constitutional amendment through.
11/9/16, 9:51 AM ~ Sean B~ I think I'm gonna donate whatever proceeds I get from trump tax cuts to women's health and/or NAACP.
11/9/16, 9:57 AM ~ Sean B~ Assuming we get tax cuts.  We'd better at least get that in exchange for having to endure this imbecile for 4 years
11/9/16, 9:59 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Woof
11/9/16, 9:59 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Yeah
11/9/16, 9:59 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Not a bad idea
11/9/16, 10:02 AM ~ Dave Wu~ He'll probably provide some good fodder for comedians too. Some good laughs while shit's burning.
11/9/16, 10:03 AM ~ Dave Wu~ The glass is only half full of piss.
11/9/16, 10:13 AM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
11/9/16, 10:21 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Changes to immigration might make things complicated with the lady friend too.
11/9/16, 10:24 AM ~ james e mooradian~ 😕
11/9/16, 10:52 AM ~ Dave Wu~ And that's the way the news goes!
11/9/16, 12:40 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Political talk is cropping up in the office around the lunch hour. Per usual, I passively absorb the opinions and add it to my coworker dossiers.
11/9/16, 12:44 PM ~ Dave Wu~ But goddamn, I just wanna heat up my pizza and avoid talking politics.
11/9/16, 12:45 PM ~ Sean B~ It's pretty awkward around here.  People trying to talk about without really talking about it
11/9/16, 12:45 PM ~ Sean B~ Or just kind of wandering around with sad lost looks in their eye
11/9/16, 5:29 PM ~ Sean B~ Some good points http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_58236ad5e4b0aac62488cde5?section=us_politics
11/9/16, 9:37 PM ~ Alex C~ Those are some good points
11/9/16, 9:38 PM ~ Alex C~ Did you guys happen to hear about that kid who got arrested for grabbing a girl's ass at UConn?
11/9/16, 9:39 PM ~ Alex C~ They got surveillance footage of him running away after he did it and they sent out still frames of him to the entire campus. He was found and arrested in like an hour
11/9/16, 9:39 PM ~ Alex C~ And then the next day, a guy guilty of the exact same thing became president
11/9/16, 9:40 PM ~ Alex C~ What an amazing time
11/9/16, 9:43 PM ~ Dave Wu~ That kid's probably gonna be a registered sex offender for life. Definitely not holding any public office.
11/9/16, 10:37 PM ~ Sean B~ And the guy who got elected actually went one further and 'grabbed em by the pussy'.  That guy will sit in the Oval Office.
11/10/16, 9:01 AM ~ james e mooradian~ That was a legit article Sean. Seems like that's the consensus on why we have a literal crazy person as a president-elect
11/10/16, 9:02 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Also I'm torn about the guy who grabbed the girls ass. Was it particularly heinous?
11/10/16, 9:04 AM ~ james e mooradian~ I've had my ass grabbed on numerous occasions at UConn. I totally understand getting rid of shit like this but I do wonder about how prevalent it seemed to be when we were undergrads
11/10/16, 9:27 AM ~ Sean B~ Yeah... I'm definitely guilty of a few ass grabs back in the day, specifically admist spring weekend mobs
11/10/16, 9:31 AM ~ Sean B~ I think the social climate right now is hypersensitive about this stuff because people are fed up with men getting away with harassing/assaulting women.  Which is understandable.  But obviously it's not black and white, there is a huge difference between grabbing someone's butt and raping someone.  So yeah I'd hope this guys life doesn't get ruined by it, but also important to recognize the behavior is wrong and call people out for it
11/10/16, 9:41 AM ~ james e mooradian~ I'm totally with you on needing to make a cultural change on this front. It just worries me that so many people are going to ignore the nuances to these issues in light of trump being elected
11/10/16, 9:41 AM ~ james e mooradian~ I've seen/heard more hate speech in the past 36 hours than ive heard in the last year combined
11/10/16, 9:41 AM ~ Sean B~ Yeah I know.  Even oppressed people can succumb to mob mentality
11/10/16, 9:42 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Most of it has come from Aru and her friends, and from liberal media outlets
11/10/16, 9:42 AM ~ james e mooradian~ I worry that it's going to become very draconian as opposed to being understanding
11/10/16, 9:42 AM ~ james e mooradian~ It can definitely lead to some serious conflicts
11/10/16, 9:43 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Looks like we're in for a wild ride these next few years
11/10/16, 10:22 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Yeah definitely not condoning any form of sexual assault. The issue shouldn't be black and white but accessing nuances takes time and resources.
11/10/16, 11:03 AM ~ Dave Wu~ I think the problem here and around the world is that human labor intensive industry has come and gone at a rate that far outstrips the life span of the existing labor pool. Basically we are left with a large number of people but no jobs. When you boil down all the racism, religious fanaticism, and other forms of hate; it comes down to the human struggle of finding basic resources food, shelter, water, energy source, and something to occupy/placate the human mind (pursuit of happiness). Most people either lack these things completely or have a bare minimum but no guarantee of a regular supply. I still believe if we as humanity can solidify this supply of basic needs and guarantee equal availability to every human, the majority of the humanities problems will be an after thought with a few generations. Automation also makes this much easier to accomplish. Of course, this probably will have to be done asking with some considerably less palatable things like secular education and a sustained level of birth control (active or passive methods)
11/10/16, 11:08 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Sounds like communism but it can more like be placed within the constructs of a Western democracy and accomplished through private industry. Fully automating the supply of such resources also addresses the contentious issue of who laborers while others benefit.
11/10/16, 11:08 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Just the musings of an office drone.
11/10/16, 1:07 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah I think the whole free trade and automation thing is similar to the problem of gentrification.  You have these unstoppable forces that are irreversible and technically beneficial for the greater society in the long run but in the process some people get fucked over.  So the question is how do you deal with that?  Libertarian view is 'too bad, adapt or die'.  The opposite extreme is to be Luddites and prevent any change or progress altogether.  Neither really seems like a good strategy
11/10/16, 2:39 PM ~ Dave Wu~ It's a matter of how free trade and automation are used. Do you choose to concentrate the gains in the hands of a few and perpetuate the historical inequalities? Or do you use the current unprecedented global connectivity and ability to separate humans from labor to proliferate something that benefits everyone? Unfortunately humans are selfish and short sighted. The libertarian and Luddite views are just different sides on the same selfish coin.
11/10/16, 2:41 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Allow either to run their way and, well, you have where we are today.
11/10/16, 2:43 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I think you guys would appreciate player piano
11/10/16, 2:44 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Pretty solid novel, but it definitely takes an anti automation view
11/10/16, 2:48 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Hmm I'll need to stop by the libs later and give this book a read.
11/10/16, 6:09 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>

11/10/16, 7:30 PM ~ Dave Wu~ #life
11/10/16, 8:08 PM ~ Alex C~ Good ol' billy red face was on Conan talking about the election and sports. Definitely some good stuff, there's three segments 
https://youtu.be/OjNgm7TgsgA
11/10/16, 8:12 PM ~ Alex C~ Actually only two segments
11/10/16, 9:26 PM ~ Sean B~ Haha classic billy boy
11/10/16, 9:38 PM ~ Alex C~ 'Trump is such a dope, he's actually gonna make me vote for a woman.' Haha offending both sides in one tweet

11/11/16, 3:58 PM ~ Dave Wu~ And yep I anticipate the Trump presidency to be more of a comedy gold mine than the Bush years. Unless shit really goes super far right, then ain't nothing funny.

11/11/16, 4:21 PM ~ Sean B~ How did you post a gif? Does whatsapp support that now?

11/11/16, 4:35 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha amazing
11/11/16, 11:15 PM ~ Sean B~ Numb the existential horror of adulthood with some cheese and banana  https://instagram.com/p/BMp-HXxF0ag/
11/12/16, 10:56 AM ~ Alex C~ Haha, it's amazing how there's no background music for a lot of mr. rogers segments. This one is just crackly silence and a man describing how to eat a cheese-wrapped banana. So peaceful
11/12/16, 12:36 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah it really takes me to a happy place
11/12/16, 12:38 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Dang I wanna move to Mr Rogers neighborhood.
11/12/16, 12:52 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Though property prices in the Neighborhood of Make Believe must be off the chain there. Heard they extending the electric trolley line and driving the puppets into the real world.
11/13/16, 11:17 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Btw Dave Chappelle on SNL last night was pretty dope. Opening monologue was some classic stand-up.
11/13/16, 11:26 AM ~ Sean B~ Yeah it was incredible
11/13/16, 4:49 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
11/13/16, 5:01 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Wtf lol
11/13/16, 5:21 PM ~ Sean B~ We've all been there.  'The Attic' as it was known to Jim
11/13/16, 5:21 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I was too high up

11/15/16, 1:15 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Jesus, I guess the value of my house shot up according to the Somerville accessor. Bad news is my tax bill nearly doubled. Kinda glad my current set of tenants are moving out. The city is really forcing my hand to flip the dick down.
11/15/16, 1:16 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I'm basics tied to a system of trickle down ass fuckery
11/15/16, 1:16 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Basically*
11/15/16, 1:39 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Shit's really off here, dunno when it's gonna break.
11/15/16, 2:02 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Yeah but it'll go back to being great again
11/15/16, 2:03 PM ~ Sean B~ So great.  It's gonna be terrific, let me tell you, it's gonna be , it's gonna be big league.  China, China, jobs, big league, great
11/15/16, 2:12 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Btw is the majority of the increase tied to property value increase nearby or is it more a result of your renovations?
11/15/16, 2:12 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Can't wait to find out what 'great' means. Think I might look for great with a house in the wooded mountains.
11/15/16, 2:13 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Best get solar panels while they're competitive against big oil
11/15/16, 2:13 PM ~ james e mooradian~ That keystone XXL is gonna lay some serious pipe
11/15/16, 2:13 PM ~ Dave Wu~ It's related to the nearby sales. I'm pretty sure the city has no idea what type of reno has happened
11/15/16, 2:14 PM ~ Sean B~ At least trump will probably cut your taxes
11/15/16, 2:14 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Damn that's popping off
11/15/16, 2:14 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Do you have an estate tax on that house? Doubt it's worth enough for it but it could be getting close
11/15/16, 2:14 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Otherwise you're shit out of luck
11/15/16, 2:17 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Lol love how the keystone is that xxl pipe
11/15/16, 2:19 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Estate tax? Isn't that a post grey veil tax on your inheritors?
11/15/16, 2:25 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Oh maybe
11/15/16, 2:25 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Also I don't think trump will cut the local property tax. It's pretty low as it stands. They really don't need to up taxes when property prices are already wiggity wiggity whack. And as soon as the union sq and expanded assembly housing developments come into play, it's gonna be an ass so tight it won't even let your nuts out situation.
11/15/16, 2:25 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I thought it might have to do with more pricey homes but u think you're right
11/15/16, 2:26 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Income tax and estate seems to be where he is concentrating his cuts
11/15/16, 2:26 PM ~ Dave Wu~ But goddamn who the fuck can afford to live there.
11/15/16, 2:26 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Ads
11/15/16, 2:26 PM ~ Dave Wu~ AIDS?
11/15/16, 2:28 PM ~ james e mooradian~ nah man ads. They're pushing out all the humans, making sure none can afford to live any where
11/15/16, 2:29 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Lol that south park ref

11/15/16, 4:55 PM ~ james e mooradian~ thought this was pretty insightful
11/15/16, 5:14 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Well after reading the posts, Trump is the definition of a wild card. He is whatever people see they need.
11/15/16, 5:14 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Even when his statements are outlandish and contradictory.
11/15/16, 5:36 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Wubbie lubbie doop doop

11/16/16, 7:32 PM ~ Sean B~ I dunno why I find that so funny. Just imagining the dominos delivery car rolling into my driveway with a dead guy inside.  Free pizza!
11/16/16, 7:33 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Do you still tip when cars drive themselves?
11/16/16, 7:33 PM ~ Alex C~ Hahaha, gingerly grab the pizza and shove him back into the seat and then send the car back on its way
11/16/16, 7:34 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Ah man that's a bummer... Oh look cheesy bread.
11/16/16, 7:34 PM ~ Alex C~ And that's the waaaayy the news goes
11/16/16, 7:35 PM ~ Sean B~ Just the idea that cars could be unknowingly carting around dead people.  Like one cuts you off and go to to flip them off and ur like oh shit it's a dead guy
11/16/16, 8:59 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
11/16/16, 9:05 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Haha. This is awesome.

11/17/16, 10:18 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Just saw on the news the CT DOT is doing a $1.3 million traffic study on i95. Hope that isn't going on your plate, Jim.
11/17/16, 10:22 AM ~ Sean B~ '$1.3 million traffic study to be conducted by one dude on laptop'
11/17/16, 10:57 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Lol nah that's my coworker
11/17/16, 10:57 AM ~ james e mooradian~ That project isn't nearly under-budgeted and behind schedule enough for me to take a look at
11/17/16, 11:13 AM ~ Dave Wu~ So basically it'll be your project in a few months if your coworker fucks up.
11/17/16, 11:16 AM ~ james e mooradian~ When*
11/17/16, 11:20 AM ~ james e mooradian~ <Media omitted>
11/17/16, 11:21 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Haha. At least you got those quality wacarnolds rib sandwich reports on lock and the company gots to come through you.
11/17/16, 11:23 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Also hearing 'He's trying!'
11/18/16, 8:35 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Crap, just drank a jar of cold brew concentrate thinking it was regular coffee, now my brain is gonna get all existential during the workday.
11/18/16, 8:46 AM ~ Sean B~ Them brain balls bout to get tickled

11/19/16, 4:48 PM ~ Sean B~ Dual laptops
11/19/16, 4:52 PM ~ Alex C~ Is that your place in Somerville? Living minimally definitely has its perks.
11/19/16, 4:55 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Yep minimal living is definitely better. Been helping my parents clean out their basement in CT and it's like how did we accumulate so much stuff.
11/19/16, 4:56 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Sometimes you need a second laptops to help out with the wfh boredom
11/19/16, 4:57 PM ~ Alex C~ https://youtu.be/y2I0JlwBaBs
11/19/16, 4:57 PM ~ Dave Wu~ More like I didn't put away the work comp after when.
11/19/16, 4:57 PM ~ Alex C~ Made me think of that Chappell bit about if you could live in a cardboard box and still get laid, men would
11/19/16, 5:11 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Lol add modern plumbing and I'd definitely live in a box.
11/19/16, 5:12 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Wonder if Chappelle is gonna get back on the stand-up circuit. Seems like he's been reappearing in things

11/21/16, 9:17 AM ~ Sean B~ Guy in the bathroom stall just straight up taking a business call while pinching out a loaf
11/21/16, 9:32 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Doing business while doing business
11/21/16, 9:33 AM ~ Dave Wu~ And now it's time to self inject myself a flu shot yay
11/21/16, 10:00 AM ~ Alex C~ That actually sounds really convenient.

11/22/16, 5:55 PM ~ Alex C~ <Media omitted>
11/22/16, 5:56 PM ~ Alex C~ That's how I'm going to conclude the presentation
11/22/16, 6:02 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Aw sheeeut. Time to put in a PTO day and call the Get Wet Girls.
11/22/16, 6:05 PM ~ Sean B~ Nice!!
11/22/16, 6:05 PM ~ Alex C~ Yup, assuming I don't really f up somehow in the next couple weeks, I'll finally be done

11/22/16, 6:08 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Well, if it's any encouragement, the Get Wet Girls ain't getting any younger... Meditate on that.
11/22/16, 6:08 PM ~ Alex C~ Hahaha oh god
11/22/16, 6:08 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Jk.... Don't meditate on that image...Good luck on the final stretch
11/22/16, 8:42 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah best of luck.  Can't wait to blow my nerd load when I catch a glimpse of those findings
11/22/16, 9:29 PM ~ Alex C~ Thanks!
11/23/16, 10:26 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Some people at the office wanna play Christmas music for holiday spirit. Perhaps I should suggest some Dipset Christmas.
11/23/16, 1:42 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Never avoid the office lottery pool. It's a waste of money, but there's always that super slim chance you'll be the last and only person working.
11/23/16, 4:27 PM ~ Sean B~ What's office lottery pool?
11/23/16, 4:28 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Lottery tickets for powerball

11/24/16, 11:05 AM ~ Dave Wu~ This Thanksgiving I'm thankful for not being married with kids like most of the people on my Facebook news feed. And the ample opportunities for dicking around.
11/24/16, 11:06 AM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
11/24/16, 11:11 AM ~ Sean B~ The irony is that in 10 years we'll probably have kids and be like 'remember when we used to be cynical assholes drifting aimlessly thru life making fun of people with families when we were the ones who were dead inside'  #ohwell
11/24/16, 11:38 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Nah, I'm gonna be a cool dad.
11/24/16, 11:42 AM ~ Sean B~ Cool dad listening to cool dad bands

11/24/16, 3:14 PM ~ Dave Wu~ No politics at the table, but having a debate about raising kids in the social media world.

11/24/16, 8:44 PM ~ james e mooradian~ No soggy bottoms this Thanksgiving
11/25/16, 12:44 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Ah, love how most of my family assumes I'm up to a whole lotta nothing because I live at home and my job seems to have little relation to my schooling. Flying under the radar... Just the way I like it.
11/25/16, 1:19 PM ~ Sean B~ 'Dave of course is up to NOTHING'

11/26/16, 10:34 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Guess everyone has the weekend free, so the entire neighborhood is buzzing with leaf blowers. I'm pretty sure I could record all the lawn care sounds throughout the year and release a drone album.
11/26/16, 10:35 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Also reminds me of the don hertzfeldt film and the long ass leaf blower scene
11/26/16, 10:50 AM ~ Dave Wu~ https://youtu.be/1IUX0Qy-IDM
11/26/16, 10:50 AM ~ Dave Wu~ The pipe is leaking....
11/26/16, 11:33 AM ~ Alex C~ I love how that guy's animations go from harmless and silly to super dark super fast and then back
11/26/16, 4:00 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Gazing upon the chaos of shoppers and goods piled high at the Costco.... Damn it feels good to live in a Western country...Or at least until we realized we've consumed beyond the point of no return.
11/26/16, 4:47 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
11/26/16, 5:15 PM ~ Alex C~ When we die there is nothing. Until then, there's French toast. Ooooeeee

11/28/16, 9:27 PM ~ Sean B~ But on another note... At 2:57 : 'You've worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.'  Ouch.
11/28/16, 9:28 PM ~ Sean B~ Just tryin to vibe to a wholesome kidz movie.  Why they gotta hit me with the RL so hard

12/6/16, 8:18 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Going to a client party hosted by my realtor. Basically get to meet all different levels of folks involved in running a gentrification train on Somerville. The places you'll go... I'm not sure about them.
12/6/16, 8:19 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Also fucking hate social functions.
12/6/16, 11:03 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I told her I was against gentrification and all about social justice.... But shit I just wanna plow everything and salt the fields until the boulder rolls back

12/7/16, 12:01 PM ~ Sean B~ sneaky*

12/7/16, 6:44 PM ~ Sean B~ I've done that so many times
12/7/16, 6:51 PM ~ Alex C~ Haha me too
12/7/16, 7:17 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Even worse hanging two lonely bananas on the hanging rack fully knowing it won't work after eating one.
12/8/16, 10:15 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Walked into the office, hear a co-worker yell 'We setting ourselves up for suck, people!!' It's gonna be a great day.
12/8/16, 10:22 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Lmao
12/8/16, 10:45 AM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
12/8/16, 11:46 AM ~ Alex C~ Hahaha
12/8/16, 11:48 AM ~ Sean B~ Lol
12/9/16, 2:17 PM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
12/9/16, 2:18 PM ~ Sean B~ LOL
12/9/16, 11:11 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Is that blue placemat like your bread casting couch? Bringing in those fresh baguettes and spreading 'em.
12/9/16, 11:12 PM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha yup exactly
12/9/16, 11:12 PM ~ Sean B~ 'You know you can make a lot of money in this business.... But first I need to see how you perform... *zip*'
12/10/16, 1:47 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
12/10/16, 1:49 PM ~ Alex C~ Amazing haha, I'm just picturing some old lady walking by the tree like 'ooo that's nice, well what does this one say?'
12/10/16, 2:13 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Nice. Wish I could bring some weird to the vanilla tree at the office.
12/12/16, 1:13 PM ~ Dave Wu~ So any of y'all have office Christmas parties coming up?
12/12/16, 1:15 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Learn things about your co-workers you wish you could unlearn.
12/12/16, 1:15 PM ~ Sean B~ Yeah I have one on Friday
12/12/16, 1:28 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Same. Gotta smile and be pleasant to the people I regularly berate at the other office... Should be fun.
12/12/16, 1:45 PM ~ james e mooradian~ I have 3 Christmas parties to go to this weekend, and I know a combined 2 people at all 3 of them
12/12/16, 1:45 PM ~ james e mooradian~ My plan is to drink exactly the right amount of booze to bullshit through them without making an ass of myself
12/12/16, 1:51 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Maybe you should leave James at home and let Jimmy go to the party.
12/12/16, 1:55 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Also found out the day after the Costco Christmas party there's always awkward sales of plan b at the pharmacy, hopefully I'm not working that day.
12/12/16, 2:00 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Oh, to be young and employed by a major wholesale chain
12/12/16, 2:01 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Oh also supposedly plan b is over the counter in NY state. No idea how that works but I saw them next to the rest of the 'family planning' items at one of the CVS's down there
12/12/16, 2:05 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Wow, I guess that makes it's a hell of a lot easier to buy plan b with Martinelli's apple juice.
12/12/16, 2:11 PM ~ Alex C~ Lol'ed pretty hard at this, Dave: 'Maybe you should leave James at home and let Jimmy go to the party.'
12/12/16, 7:13 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I think Ludacris was on to something with the area code method.
12/13/16, 1:36 PM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
12/13/16, 4:58 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Almost laughed in the phone when the pharmacy answered with 'You've reached ICP.'
12/13/16, 4:59 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Unfortunately it was Institutional Care Pharmacy.

12/13/16, 10:15 PM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
12/13/16, 10:23 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I guess if you ever get bored of baking you could make a segue into serial killing à la Jeffrey Dahmer.
12/13/16, 10:30 PM ~ Dave Wu~ ...ah making things super grim.... But seriously, is the freezer for storing dough or cooked loafs?
12/13/16, 10:33 PM ~ Sean B~ Cooked.  I bake them to about 95% done then let cool and freeze in air tight plastic.  Then when you wanna eat just thaw and pop in oven for 5-10 min.  works really well
12/13/16, 10:37 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Nice. Sounds like that could easily work as a retail method. Sneak a loaf any goddamn time of the day.
12/13/16, 11:00 PM ~ Alex C~ That's exactly what this breakfast place called Toast near UConn does. Great bread there and I thought that they must bake it themselves, but it turns out they order it frozen like that and just cook it the last bit of the way.
12/13/16, 11:08 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Haha. I guess they live up to their name. Also Toast sounds like a hipster breakfast place.
12/14/16, 10:32 PM ~ james e mooradian~ <Media omitted>

12/15/16, 10:53 AM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha
12/15/16, 11:22 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Man those hands and feet creep me the hell out
12/15/16, 11:22 AM ~ james e mooradian~ This guy really knows how to bring the weird
12/15/16, 11:29 AM ~ Dave Wu~ If I ever have kids, I'm gonna tell them every Christmas Santa squats over the chimney and magically pinches off gifts... Should make for some good parent teacher meetings.
12/15/16, 11:35 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Santa did a stint in prison. Perfected the art of keister storage.
12/15/16, 5:35 PM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
12/15/16, 5:58 PM ~ Sean B~ So true
12/16/16, 10:02 AM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
12/16/16, 10:06 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Haha I'm a Steve.
12/16/16, 10:10 AM ~ Sean B~ I used to be a Steve.  Now I love Fridays 😁
12/16/16, 10:11 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Go ride your hamster wheel, Linda!
12/16/16, 10:14 AM ~ Dave Wu~ But yeah after working in an office.... Friday's actually mean something. No doubt it's a social construct, but we're stuck in the machine whether we like it or not. And not running the wheel for two days is pretty sweet. So yep I am excited for Friday.
12/16/16, 10:15 AM ~ Dave Wu~ So Uncle Steve is a real piece of shit.
12/16/16, 10:17 AM ~ Alex C~ Speaking of hamster wheels, I had an interview on Wednesday at the Army Research Lab. I'm actually pretty excited about potentially working there. The funny thing was that the head of the branch that I was interviewing at is named Cindy. And people kept saying things like, 'oh we'll just run that by Cindy'. And all I could think of was Cindy Burns from Jim's 15 min avant garde vox recording.
12/16/16, 10:44 AM ~ Sean B~ Hahaha good ol Cindy Byrne
12/16/16, 10:47 AM ~ Sean B~ That's awesome though.  Just don't let them trick you into making bombs
12/16/16, 10:53 AM ~ Alex C~ I'd be a civilian contractor in a group working on basic science for fuel cells and batteries. It turns out that efficient energy technologies are good for combat because they're silent and can potentially be easier to transport. So even climate-change-denying Trump will effectively be funding research to fight climate change by funding the department of defense. That said, other groups at the lab work on some pretty deadly sheeuuutt.
12/16/16, 10:54 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Toyota Priuses are great for drive bys.
12/16/16, 10:56 AM ~ Dave Wu~ But that's awesome if you can land a job with army research. Probably get a pretty sweet benefits package from the gov.
12/16/16, 10:57 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Prius Ref. from Weeds
12/16/16, 11:06 AM ~ Alex C~ Haha silent but deadly
12/16/16, 11:32 AM ~ Dave Wu~ <Media omitted>
12/16/16, 11:33 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Damn Alex, that sounds like pretty exciting work
12/16/16, 12:43 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol
12/16/16, 1:09 PM ~ Sean B~ Just saw rogue one.  It's good.  Admiral Akbar makes an appearance which alone makes it worth it.
12/16/16, 3:44 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Captain choke at the office party.... Memories
12/16/16, 3:45 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Coke*.... Captain choke would be a bdsm name.
12/16/16, 4:29 PM ~ Sean B~ This classic just popped up in my newsfeed.  Still amazing http://www.theonion.com/article/bard-college-named-nations-no-1-dinner-party-schoo-19032
12/16/16, 6:05 PM ~ Dave Wu~ I wish I went to a dinner party school.
12/16/16, 6:21 PM ~ Alex C~ don't you remember family dinners on Sundays in Prudence? Haha
12/16/16, 6:22 PM ~ Sean B~ Taco night!!
12/16/16, 6:38 PM ~ Dave Wu~ What did you learn this week?
12/16/16, 6:45 PM ~ Alex C~ Haha
12/16/16, 6:46 PM ~ Sean B~ John never cleaning up his dishes
12/16/16, 9:05 PM ~ Dave Wu~ We were sooo cool!
12/16/16, 9:06 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Shit all this reminiscing got me craving a blueberry pancake corn dog.
12/17/16, 9:26 AM ~ Sean B~ https://hardsci.wordpress.com/2016/08/11/everything-is-fucked-the-syllabus/
12/17/16, 9:35 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Haha this is great
12/17/16, 11:24 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Lmao that is legitimately a class I would've wanted to sign up for
12/17/16, 11:24 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Also
12/17/16, 11:25 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Week 7 interlude: everything is fine, calm the fuck down
12/17/16, 11:25 AM ~ james e mooradian~ 👌🏼
12/17/16, 11:26 AM ~ Sean B~ Haha I saw that
12/17/16, 7:26 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Btw Mr robot on USA is a pretty good show. Y'all should check it out.

12/18/16, 5:14 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Yeah this is a thing. Read about it in the Atlantic and had to check it out. It's from Japan. I guess it's a tedium/patience hobby like ship in a bottle.
12/18/16, 5:23 PM ~ Sean B~ Japanese people still bringing the weird hard as ever
12/19/16, 8:55 AM ~ Sean B~ <Media omitted>
12/19/16, 9:02 AM ~ james e mooradian~ That is the face of someone who's been discreetly wanking in the workplace
12/19/16, 9:09 AM ~ Sean B~ Workin hard as usual eh Ted
12/19/16, 11:23 AM ~ Dave Wu~ That's one shifty looking mother fucker. Looks like a guy who would leave turds around the office.

12/19/16, 7:17 PM ~ Alex C~ Looks like I got the job at the army research lab. I'll be moving down to D.C. sometime in February I think.
12/19/16, 7:17 PM ~ Alex C~ Very excitement
12/19/16, 7:18 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Awesome, congrats dude!
12/19/16, 7:18 PM ~ Sean B~ Wow that's awesome! Congrats
12/19/16, 7:19 PM ~ Sean B~ DC is supposed to be cool
12/19/16, 7:19 PM ~ Dave Wu~ Also ranks 5th in rent
12/19/16, 7:20 PM ~ Sean B~ Is that technically a post-doc position?
12/19/16, 8:26 PM ~ Alex C~ Thanks! Yeah, it's a post doc.
12/19/16, 9:57 PM ~ Dave Wu~ https://open.spotify.com/album/0usp3IeDhbEXgoCc3f6PzZ
12/20/16, 9:45 AM ~ james e mooradian~ Congrats Alex! Sounds like it's a really exciting position
12/20/16, 9:46 AM ~ james e mooradian~ DC is a fun place too, if on the professional side
12/20/16, 11:48 AM ~ Alex C~ Thanks!
12/20/16, 2:17 PM ~ Dave Wu~ This idea just popped in my head.... Death metal band but all the growling lyrics are excerpts from tax law and bits of financial advice.
12/20/16, 2:20 PM ~ Sean B~ Lol

12/21/16, 11:50 AM ~ Sean B~ Baking up some new bread recipes that are gonna blow yalls minds. Planning to bring a bunch up for New Years
12/21/16, 11:51 AM ~ Dave Wu~ Do a drive by on our taste buds?
12/21/16, 11:54 AM ~ Sean B~ More like gonna flip the dick down on your taste buds
12/21/16, 11:56 AM ~ Dave Wu~ I wish WhatsApp had a running tally of booyah quotes in group chat.
12/21/16, 11:56 AM ~ Sean B~ I could probably compute that with their API lol
12/21/16, 12:01 PM ~ james e mooradian~ We should make a word cloud of our WhatsApp chat
12/21/16, 12:01 PM ~ james e mooradian~ Btw Dave, let me know if you're gonna be in ct on the day before we go up. Would not mind doing a joint run to Costco to get all the additional meat for the minivan
12/21/16, 12:01 PM ~ james e mooradian~ And maybe a plant or two
