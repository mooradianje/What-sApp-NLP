 Someone posted this on Facebook the other day.  Just take a moment to appreciate this epitome of shitty 90s nu metal.  Everything about it is a stereotype of the genre.  Like a poor mans linkin park.

 Remember that article one of yall posted a while back about when and when not to 'give a fuck' and learning to ration out your fuck-giving? Where was that from? Anyone still have the link?
 YES
 thank you
 Hell yeah
 You won't regret it
 Awesome
 So here's a little anecdote I think yall will appreciate.  I recently found out via Facebook that a kid I used to go to prep school with went to divinity school and recently became ordained as a deacon in the episcopal church.  I recalled a particular conversation I had with him in 7th grade about our mutual interest in pornography.  He confided in me that he especially enjoyed videos of anal porn because he 'loves the sound the girl makes when it goes in'.  Yeah.  Now the dude is serving people communion on Sundays.
 Yup
 Lol.  It actually might have been 8th grade.  Not that that really makes it any better
 But yeah even I was a bit taken aback at the time
 Being all of 14 years old
 Yeah.  Or limewire
 'Back in my day we had to work for our porn!'
 Lol nice
 Yep
 Glad I'm not a TA anymore
 Haha these are great
 You should make a tumblr of these

 Yeah I think everyone has a different 'best time' of their life.  For some unfortunate people it was high school... Wouldn't want to be one of them.
 The goal should be to 'peak' as late as possible.  Or never.  Just keep getting more awesome
 Hahaha amen
" Does anyone still have that long comic from last year with Mickey, Goofy, and Donald Duck.  Feel like a second dose of that is needed after yesterday's musings"
 Yeah most of it is kind of gloomy but the end really ties it together on a brighter note.
 When Micky realizes he is #blessed to have his buddies
" 'It's just crazy cause I was just thinking, I don't have any friends who I've known my whole life. You guys all watched each other the whole way...you've all come so far. You're all doing new and exciting stuff and leading these crazy lives and you've still got so much to do. I wish I had a friend like that. Who was with me for like, the whole journey.'"
 Fuckin gets me right in the feels every time
 <Media omitted>

 Lol damn dude. Props for fighting back tho

" Speaking of beards... I was out on a date last night at a bar.  Some random guy walks up to me and says 'I'm sorry man but I just have to do this real quick' and starts stroking my beard for a couple seconds, then walks away.  Few minutes later his friend comes up and explains that he bet the other guy that he wouldn't try to touch my beard.  I chuckled heartily.  He bought me a beer because he lost the bet."
 Really getting some serious ROI out of this thing

 I've already wrapped up my car search tho.  We pulled the trigger yesterday on a black RAV4.  Practical and understated but rugged enough to facilitate my Outdoorsy Bro rebranding effort.

 The whistles go wooooo
 Yikes I just got an offer letter from Amazon..
 That's gonna be a tough decision
 Thanks guys.  Not sure if I'll end up taking it but it's definitely a good feeling to have made it all the way with one of the top tech companies.
 Plus now I have leverage to go in and stonewall other companies for more $$$ lol
 And then I'll make them watch ME jerk off

" So today I dropped a real triumphant one in my toilet and clogged it real bad.  Plunged it 6 or 7 times, no dice.  Ended up driving to Home Depot to buy a snake. Then came home and had to watch some tutorials on YouTube to learn how to operate it.  Then I had to snake my own toilet, and dislodged a massive turd from deep within.  It was not a pleasant experience. But somewhat proud I finally dropped a David Wu caliber deuce."

 Yeah I'm actually kind of relieved.  Wasn't too psyched about the idea of living there and paying retarded rent for a shoebox apartment.  Still would have been nice to get an offer though.
 Man their hiring bar is like soooo fuckin high though.  I knew it was high but like god damn. The recruiter did me the courtesy of reading through all 4 of my interviewers' feedback detailing every mistake and shortcoming of my solutions.
 Like cool bro thanks
 And I was like 'ok but can they freestyle rap in a Scottish accent? ... Didn't think so'
 They really can't

 Scrolling through the 'people you may know' page on LinkedIn and laughing at how virtually all of the d-bag types I knew from high school are all 'business analysts' and 'account executives'
 Yeah this one dudes job title is literally just 'analyst'
 I think analyst is basically code word for 'I work at the business factory and make excel sheets all day'
 Account executive is corposeak for salesman

 It was so funny
 And then we proceeded to look up random company websites and laugh at the About pages
 Because they really do all sound like that
 Haha yeah
 It's pretty frustrating.  Feels like close to half of all tech companies basically just make some kind of analytics platform

" Didn't use caramel color, but increased the amounts of cocoa, molasses and coffee to darken the color.  Worked decently well"
 lol that's amazing
 Thanks! A couple things:  If the dough has already been refrigerated you generally need to increase the pre-bake resting time by about 1.5x to 2x.  Also you may just need to bake it longer.  I've yet to over-cook a loaf.  I use a kitchen scale to weigh the dough beforehand to know how big the portion is.  The book's bake times assume a certain weight.  The time has to be increased if the loaf is heavier.

" Sorry my whatsapp seemed to have been turned off for the past few days.  I'm not sure off the top of my head but guaranteed there is a solution.  Potentially something even built in to the python library if that's what you're using.  There are all kinds of disk-caching techniques that can get around the memory limit problem, I'm sure there must be something available for graph libraries"
" 10 thousand nodes is not a big number though for a graph, so I'm not sure exactly where the memory problem is coming from.  What data are you storing in each node?"
 What are the values in each matrix?  Also is this a known algorithm or something you came up Erin?
 came up with*
 Hmm ok yeah so that's gonna yield 800MB per matrix. And if there's 4 total then 3.2GB.  Doable but if the parallel workers are all making duplicate copies then that's definitely gonna be a problem
 Im assuming the 64 bit numbers are distances or edge weights of some sort?
 Yeah the mapreduce approach is typically applied to these kinds of problems I think
 The real dominating factor is the NxN.  When you have sparse graphs you can use a different representation to use less space but not sure that's applicable to your situation
" Well technically 0 and infinity occupy the same amount of bits, unless the implementation doesn't allocate any memory for 0 values.  Hard to say without knowing what's under the hood"
 Oh cool
" Yeah.  Biggest win would come from reducing duplication of the matrices and somehow allowing workers to handle only subsets of the matrices, which is the kind of thing mapreduce tends to do"
" Would definitely look into the datastore library.  Looks like the kind of thing I've seen in the past to handle super big arrays.  Basically you can store the matrix on disk and read a subset of rows/columns into memory, rather than having to read the entire thing"

" Agree with Alex, it can take time.  But I am more worried about your own mental health.  Feeling 'dead inside' is not normal and very unhealthy.  You should feel free to talk to us any time but also try to get professional help as well.  I have periodically struggled with similar feelings over the past few years and only recently finally decided I am going to do something about it and get help.  It's not a good way to live."
" I can definitely understand.  I've found that social isolation can be a particular hard thing to deal with and overcome.  Especially because it can be self-perpetuating, as in it causes you to feel bad but that in turn can make other people seem even more foreign because it seems like they are living in a different world and can't really understand, which causes you to feel worse, etc.  It's very difficult."
 When it comes to romantic relationships I believe in keeping communication as open as possible.  If you really like this girl and want to make it work I would suggest just being honest with her about what you're going through and how you feel.  It may be difficult for her but it's almost always better to have honest communication than for her to feel like she's in the dark and has no idea what's wrong.  She might be wrongly blaming herself or drawing incorrect conclusions.  You may even find that you feel closer to her after laying it all out on the table.  Maybe not.  But it has worked for me in the past.
 Splits text?
" Damn sorry dude that's too bad.  If it were me I would still probably apologize and offer some explanation, just out of courtesy even if it's not going to salvage the relationship."
" Yeah I agree, I hadn't even considered that aspect.  I probably would have been uncomfortable as well. It's definitely not an easy thing to do"
 Yeah I think all the messaging apps are doing it as a result of the FBI vs Apple fiasco
 Yeah I am
" Absolutely Dave.  Dating is hard and trying to find someone you're compatible with takes a lot of work and learning, but I know you will find a great girl one of these days.  It's 100% worth it in the end"
" Jim I can definitely put you in touch with Ross, he loves to talk to people.  Just send me your email and I can do an introduction"
 This new article just came out in the times about emotion and masculinity.  I think it's really good and an important topic.  Basically a serious/scientific version of Bill Burr's 'what are you a faaaagg?' joke. Glad to see this making its way into public discourse because I think it's a huge problem and almost no one talks about it. http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/education/edlife/teaching-men-to-be-emotionally-honest.html?smprod=nytcore-ipad&smid=nytcore-ipad-share&_r=0

 Took about 4-5 days to get a fully active culture going.  But once you get that you can store it in the fridge and feed it just once per week to keep it alive
 It took around 10 hours for the dough to rise
 And you gotta fold it periodically during that time.  Definitely at least a full day commitment.  But it sure is cool as hell

 Sweeeet
 Nice!
 My place is available if any of y'all need a place to stay
 Nah don't do that.  We can make it work.  Unless you really prefer to
 Whatever y'all wanna do
 Also was thinking it would be nice to do some kind of activity together other than the party if there's time.  Maybe on Sunday
 Umm good question.  Party officially starts at 8.  But I should be around if you want to come up earlier and bro down
" Ok cool.  Well Jim you can plan to stay with me then, or at Daves"
 Yeah definitely.  One can take the couch and the other can have the air mattress
 Ok cool!
 Probably better to drop your stuff first so you don't have to drive after.  I could leave a key for you to get in. Do you have a Somerville parking pass now?
 Ok.  Yeah as long as they aren't dicks and ticket you before midnight.  I think Courtney already used my pass twice this week so I don't think it can be used again til next week
 Yeah that could also work
 Hahaha I'll check it out.  Love gettin my brain balls tickled
 Hahaha
 The Cambridge center for adult education is offering a class in urban beekeeping.  Might have to get in on that.  Take the personal brand to a whole new dimension

 No prob Alex
 Cool so Dave and Jim I'll hopefully have you both attending which would be rad
 Jncos mandatory. Linkin park or staind shirts also acceptable

" To the best of my knowledge... Af = 'as fuck', as in 'cool as fuck.'  Goals is used as an adjective instead of a noun.  'This shit is goals as fuck'. 100 emoji I believe is just for emphasis.  Like 'times 100' or '100%'"
 Just what the young whippersnappers be saying these days. Trying to stay relevant

 Nothing but you and the dough
 Ooh nice loaf what kind is it?
 Nice.  White bread?
 <Media omitted>
 <Media omitted>
" There was also a guy playing a banjo, and two girls dancing with LED-light up hula hoops"
 Haha yeah I thought of that.  Just like the Olympic airways video.
 Damn that thing is sick
 Been following this Instagram lately it's pretty awesome for van stuff http://instagram.com/projectvanlife
 Helping me get amped up for my trip
 Yeah shitting into a bucket doesn't make as good of an Instagram shot
 Butt wipes are a pretty good solution for dingleberries
 But yeah a tiny house with real plumbing would be cool too
 Yeah you can get a pretty nice one for less than a down payment on a regular house in New England
 Only issue id have is it would be hard to ever have guests visit
 Lol yeah I wonder how they managed that
 Wow that was quite a convo guys

 Do u even code bro
 I think it's because they don't read other girls profiles so they think they're being original
" I think the majority of people aren't very interesting (remember uconn?) or they are playing it safe by trying to focus on widely relatable things, thinking that will give them the most appeal.  But that's actually not a good strategy.  Better to focus on specific more unique things and appeal to a smaller number of better matched people.  But it takes time to learn that"
 Yeah it's all about that niche appeal
 I dunno I still think it's a better strategy for them.  A hundred irrelevant dick pics isn't very valuable
 I'm using different recipes now.  Moved on to wild yeast sourdough which is requires a longer process
 I've been using the book 'classic sourdoughs' but I think the King Arthur website also has some good ones for free

 Watch jim be dominating all of us in bread making within like a week
 Kneading with one hand while simultaneously hand grinding locally sourced grain with the other and casually carrying a conversation

 Nope I just have to post every photo twice because you're a damn Luddite hahaha
 <Media omitted>
 <Media omitted>
 Poor is the new rich
" Yeah I mean pretty much everything cool today is derived from being poor a century ago.  Making your own food, living small, etc"
 Yeah.  It's not about efficiency though it's more about entertainment.  People who do it i.e. us can afford the premium
 My sourdough loaves probably take $100 of labor at least.  Not efficient in the least but fun as hell
 No even for a baker's wage to bake just a few loaves a week would be about that expensive
" But again, not about the efficiency in these cases"
 For me I just find fulfillment in making things and learning how things are made.  Mass production is efficient but if that's all you consume it doesn't lead to a particularly interesting or fulfilling life IMO
 Need a balance as Jim says
 Like if I had to make everything myself that would not be very fun
 Yeah efficiency isn't everything
 Some of the best things in life aren't efficient.  I.e. Wrapping a turkey in a bacon weave
 You should work for the government.  Sounds like you have good macro-level ideas.  I tend to just focus on my self and hope the big picture works itself out via a plague or other catastrophic event

 Looks like the gauntlet has been thrown down. Gonna have to step my game up when I get home.
 Bake off would be awesome
 But yeah would also be good to round out the portfolio with more niche skills
 Thinking about trying cheese and butter
 We could start our own commune at that point
 Aw yeah
 Get some chutneys up in this bitch
 Same sues

 Yeah let's do Labor Day
 Unrelated but I'm drinking in a hostel in Vancouver with a bunch of foreigners and apparently Australians refer to pedophiles as 'kiddie fiddlers' and I thought that was hilarious

" Sup yallll üòÑ just got back on the grid again.  Courtney and I were backpacking in the Canadian Rockies for 3 days.  To answer your question Alex yes I have shit in the woods, a few times in Colorado and it is awesome.  Surprisingly the two places I've been backpacking though have both had outhouses at the campsites so no hole-squatting there"
 Probably because they're national parks and they want to reduce impact on the environment.  Human dookie all over the place isn't great I guess
" Still traveling, returning in early August then going on a couple short trips.  So I'll see y'all Labor Day weekend hopefully"
 Indeed
 <Media omitted>
 <Media omitted>
 <Media omitted>
 <Media omitted>
 Yeah dude it's the most insane place.  Even better than Colorado.  Google 'Banff' and look at the pics that come up.  Can't believe I had ever heard of this place
 All those effing twenty somethings

 Just a breeze loans
 Lol such a classic

 It's called emerald lake.  There are a ton like that in the area though.  Minerals from the glaciers make it that color I think
 LOL
 So good
 Alex did you defend your thesis yet?
 Oooo he's tryin!
" Aw man I really wanna come for that.  Leaving Montana on August 1st and was estimating I'd be back in mass on the 7th.  I guess there's a chance if I activate Wu-drive I could make it, but probably not super likely"

 Haha I have no idea
 Haha
 üëç
 Yeah I'm pretty sure he's gonna come
 Was planning to bring Courtney too if that's cool with everyone
 She said she'll contribute a dish or two.  Maybe a desert and a vegetable
 Maybe we should map out a build order for the weekend like last New Years haha
 She's not vegetarian FYI unless you just wanna do em for the lulz
 But she has a farmshare right now so she gets a crate full of local veggies every week so we could bring tons of good shit
 Kale fennel beets heirloom tomatoes and shit
 It's different every week
 So won't know til a couple days before
 Haha not really.  Just been working on perfecting this 50% whole wheat sourdough recipe which is pretty versatile.  Not sure if I wanna do anything additional bc the process is so time consuming
 I'll think about it though.  There's different things you can still do with the same dough
 Other ppl are welcome to make some as well
 I'm confident I can keep us supplied with loaves
 Haha
 Lol wow
 Christ almighty
 Bet they're jackin tuition up like a motherfucker to cover that.  'Lifetime of debt? Nah it's just a breeze baby'
 Hahaha
 But I'm also kind of jealous that we graduated right before uconn stopped being totally shitty.  Coulda been gettin froyo and sushi on the reg
 Nope
 Weird that South is probably the shitty dining hall now
 Things done changed
 Haha wait are you having an existential crisis about the meat selection or wanting to buy meat because of said crisis?
 Dave bb r u ok?
 Wow so sorry to hear that.  That's terrible.
 Well I'm looking forward to seeing you all.  Hopefully spending some time together will be positive /helpful for you (via bros 4 life).  I will be sure to bring good vibes
 Damn that's quite a build order
 Alex is the wood oven ready for use? If so we should plan to make some kind of pizza or flatbread for one meal

 Yep
 Gonna make some real existential bread

 Can't wait to watch Jim freak that bitch out
 At rob's now bout to head out
 Probably 10:15-10:30 arrival
 Yeah what a rad weekend!

 First time trying an oval shape loaf. Kinda prefer it over boules.  Way easier to work with
 Lol
 I was just crunching some numbers actually.  Making a ton of assumptions but I think it would be possible to clear maybe 50k a year as a one man operation if you could do 100 loaves per day 5 days a week
 Not exactly internet money but you could live
 Yeah that's a good idea
 One person I follow on Instagram does a monthly bread share program similar to a farm share.  60 bucks a month for 2 loaves every week.  That's about $7 per loaf
 Lol
" It's pick-up only, no delivery"
 Shelf life too short for delivery
 Without preservatives you got like 24 hrs basically
 Yeah I dunno half baking is a little sketchy

 Yeah I dunno I don't really know whether it's harder or easier for artists to earn a living today.  Probably easier than 10 years ago at least when distributors hadn't caught up to the technology yet.
 It gets complicated whenever a small number of ppl control distribution of something though because they can basically drive the price down by being the only means of getting your product sold.  So hard to say whether a stream is really 'worth' what an artist is paid for it

 Weird there's a couple Spotify playlists for the genre but pretty much no other info on the web about it. Maybe they're trying to invent genres now
 50k for and additional 2 months of life?  Shit ain't cheap
 Seems like a bad investment
 Cashing in on the universal human fear of mortality.  Dark.

 Haters gonna hate
 Isn't oatmeal big in Germany?  Over the summer in Canada this German guy came into a cafe and tried to order oatmeal and was very disappointed when they said they didn't have any
 Yeah I'm into it
 Bagels and breakfast sandwiches are great but it gets a little old
 I'm not sure.  My team is on the older side.  The two guys close to my age both rent.  Everyone else owns homes in the burbs.
 Yeah I dunno.  Probably a tough call.  Seems like property values could climb way higher as gentrification expands into east Somerville
 Give er the ol 'pump n dump'
 Nice
 Wow so my old building is worth just shy of 1 mil.  They bought it in 1984 for $80k
 Also lol @ 'bunch of Kelly's'
 Hahaha can confirm
 As someone who used to WFH daily
 Nothin like gettin paid to beat your meat
 Lol
 <Media omitted>
 Yeah trump has really fucked up the GOP.   Even Glenn Beck has started telling people to vote for Hillary.  Kind of amusing to watch the chaos ensue
 Great place to raise a family
" I think the excise tax was prorated, so I paid for the remaining part of the year"
 As far as I know the excise is the only tax you pay on the vehicle other than sales tax
 You guys watching?  I gave up after the first debate
 Yeah last time I watched I ended up drinking an entire bottle of wine unintentionally
 Just not worth the trauma

 Accurate summary of workin at the business factory  https://mobile.twitter.com/iamdevloper/status/789234931599835136/video/1
 Yeah.  Also the 'like a boss' lonely island video.
 'Gaze out the window at the happy people.  Wish you were like them.  Considering opening a bar.'
 Exactly.
 Lol.  At kayak people are bringing their kids to trick or treat at the office.... üòû
 Lol
 The concord office is
 Cambridge is younger
 Yeah.  Everyone in concord talks about maintaining their lawns and houses and caring for children.  Pretty riveting stuff
 One of my coworkers legit started a sentence during lunch with 'so on Sunday I was thatching my lawn...'
 Wanted to be like 'that sounds awful'
 <Media omitted>
 It's like removing the dead parts I think
 And then you hang yourself in the garage
" You know, just a nice little Sunday"
 Yeah what a waste of time and energy
 But I can't imagine if you make decent money and buy something within your means it would be that expensive to pay someone to do it
 If your yard is smallish
 Yeah
 The back yard at Courtney's dads house is pretty cool.  I think it's technically mowed but it's basically moss and natural forest ground.  No fertilizing or watering needed
 Just let nature do her thang
 Yeah such bullshit
 <Media omitted>
 <Media omitted>
 It is!
 Spelt flour.  #ancientgrains
 You should snatch up some of those abandoned mill buildings... Primo converted loft space

 I strained my hip flexor pretty bad from going full-retard with hiking this summer.  Not too fun
 I think it was the other direction that did the damage.  But yes true.  They told me sitting too much can delay recovery.  I stand about half the day usually
 Yeah
 One guy at my office does standing yoga poses at his desk.  Not fuckin around.
 <Media omitted>
 Haha decision tree that's great
 Yoga guy is wearing a full beekeeper suit today for office Halloween

 Sorry Timmy no presents for Christmas this year
 Hahaha
 Aw man people are brining their kids in now.  I gotta get out of here
" Yeah really makes me nostalgic for the days workin for a startup with just a bunch of effing-twenty-somethings chillin hard, listening to bleep bloops, freestyle rapping, committing DUI on motor scooters"

 Workin hard as usual
 Lol man you gotta really like Kenny g to blast it so loud that neighbors can hear it
 Wonder if they use Kenny G torture down in Guantanamo
 Would love to see what's actually going on in that person's apartment.  I'm imaging some depraved drug fueled sex orgy
 Hahaha
 I sometimes listen to rap while making bread.  Maybe I should give ol KG a try

 Those zany youths
" The game where even when you win, you still lose"
 Just overhead some old guy in the hallway of my office building talking on the phone and he literally said this exact sentence:
" ''You know, it's just like what Obama did.  His administration blatantly discriminated against Christians and he filled his team with all Muslims instead.  And now they have the emails to prove it too.'"
 #makeamericagreatagain
 No he doesn't thank god
" Imagine living life in such a delusional state that you sincerely believed stuff like that to be true.  It kind of makes me slightly sympathetic of the crazy conservative people... Like if I really believed that I would be freaking out too.  I reminds me of when I took CS math and we were studying formal logic and my prof was saying that politics is basically all about just making logical fallacies.  Where you basically promote conclusions that are valid based on a set of premises, but usually people don't question the validity of the premises themselves, or it's difficult to do so."
 Yep
 Heard the hoes get real nasty down at club Applebee's
 Just realized Dave and Alex had birthdays last month and I totally dropped the ball.  #badfriend
 <Media omitted>
 That 3-0 comin up real quick
 That's ok though bc Alex and Dave have basically been 30 years old their whole lives üòÇ

 Shit is crazy.  Boston is slowly catching up too.  Time to move to Detroit
 The wheels on the bus go round and round
 Lol
 Can't believe 08 election was 8 years ago.   Remember waiting in line outside EO smith
 Lol
 Also I think that was the time I accidentally voted against same sex marriage in CT
 Really noobsauced on that one
 Mass might pass recreational Maryjane.  Maybe I'll diversify into artisan hydro dank
 Handcrafted by a bearded guy in plaid
 Yup
 No ballot measures for CT according to the Google
 Better trek your ass on down to EO smith then
 Maybe grab a froyo at Storrs downtown afterward
 Would love to see what kind of set up they have under the hood.  Gotta be a total nightmare.  Probably one copy of an MS access database on a single machine from 1995
 No way
 Wow...
 Tax dollars hard at work
 <Media omitted>
 Courtney's workin on her EU citizenship.  Dat backup plan
 Yeah just upload me 2 the cloud bro

 Bout to start stuffing the mattress
 <Media omitted>
 Yep.  At least I can buy a vape and smoke myself into oblivion while the country falls apart
 It's deafeningly quiet in the business factory right now
 Just crazy how wrong the polls and predictions were.  Most people never even considered this was an actual possibility.  I can't even process it
 Aggregated polls had Hillary at 93% win chance less than a week out.  About the same with prediction markets.  It was at around 83% at 8pm last night
 Yeah
 That seems to be the takeaway is that she really failed to court the blue collar workers which dems historically won.   Basically their frustration outweighed their reservations about trump's bigotry
 Bernie would have done better in that demographic
 I don't think all of them could possibly be that ignorant and hateful.  But when you gotta put food on the table that forces you to make certain choices.  Le sigh üòû
 Yeah... Silver lining is this is going to force both parties to really reevaluate shit and hopefully we'll get much better candidates next time around
 Haha good point.  As bill burr said 'lanes just opening up on the highway!'
" You can drive a tank to work.  Shoot a bald eagle in the face, ah there's plenty of em"
 Well at least gay marriage was already legalized so that can't get taken away.  Feel really bad for Courtney though bc she works in reproductive health and her whole company could basically get defunded
 Just feel bad for women in general
 Is that even repeal-able at this point?  I can't imagine he really opposes it. He's not religious
 Kinda assumed that stance was just to get votes
 I think I'm gonna donate whatever proceeds I get from trump tax cuts to women's health and/or NAACP.
 Assuming we get tax cuts.  We'd better at least get that in exchange for having to endure this imbecile for 4 years
 <Media omitted>
 It's pretty awkward around here.  People trying to talk about without really talking about it
 Or just kind of wandering around with sad lost looks in their eye
 Some good points http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_58236ad5e4b0aac62488cde5?section=us_politics
 And the guy who got elected actually went one further and 'grabbed em by the pussy'.  That guy will sit in the Oval Office.
" Yeah... I'm definitely guilty of a few ass grabs back in the day, specifically admist spring weekend mobs"
" I think the social climate right now is hypersensitive about this stuff because people are fed up with men getting away with harassing/assaulting women.  Which is understandable.  But obviously it's not black and white, there is a huge difference between grabbing someone's butt and raping someone.  So yeah I'd hope this guys life doesn't get ruined by it, but also important to recognize the behavior is wrong and call people out for it"
 Yeah I know.  Even oppressed people can succumb to mob mentality
" Yeah I think the whole free trade and automation thing is similar to the problem of gentrification.  You have these unstoppable forces that are irreversible and technically beneficial for the greater society in the long run but in the process some people get fucked over.  So the question is how do you deal with that?  Libertarian view is 'too bad, adapt or die'.  The opposite extreme is to be Luddites and prevent any change or progress altogether.  Neither really seems like a good strategy"

 I dunno why I find that so funny. Just imagining the dominos delivery car rolling into my driveway with a dead guy inside.  Free pizza!
 Just the idea that cars could be unknowingly carting around dead people.  Like one cuts you off and go to to flip them off and ur like oh shit it's a dead guy
