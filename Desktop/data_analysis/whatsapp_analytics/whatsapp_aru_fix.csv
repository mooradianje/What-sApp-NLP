9/4/2015~1:40 PM~13~9~5~james e mooradian~ 2 things I learned about crickets last nighy
9/4/2015~1:40 PM~13~9~5~james e mooradian~ First thing is that cricket chirps are surprisingly hard to locate
9/4/2015~1:41 PM~13~9~5~james e mooradian~ Second thing is they are fucking loud
9/4/2015~1:44 PM~13~9~5~james e mooradian~ It was so strange too, like it would stop for 5-10 minutes and I was like 'oh maybe its done or found its way out of my room'
9/4/2015~1:44 PM~13~9~5~james e mooradian~ Nope.

9/4/2015~2:10 PM~14~9~5~james e mooradian~ It was so small and insignificant looking that I wasn't sure if I got it at first
9/4/2015~2:10 PM~14~9~5~Aru B~ Lolol ðŸ”ªðŸ”ª?

9/4/2015~2:12 PM~14~9~5~Aru B~ But it might be worse than having a newborn

2/22/2016~12:30 PM~12~2~1~james e mooradian~ No I mean you think it was the chicken?
2/22/2016~12:30 PM~12~2~1~Aru B~ not necessarily
2/22/2016~12:31 PM~12~2~1~Aru B~ prob the oil they used
2/22/2016~12:31 PM~12~2~1~Aru B~ fried stuff usually gives me stomachache, as does most carbs/breads
2/22/2016~12:31 PM~12~2~1~james e mooradian~ Aw I see I see
2/22/2016~12:31 PM~12~2~1~james e mooradian~ We can eat better to night
2/22/2016~1:15 PM~13~2~1~Aru B~ so beata is working w/ a job outplacement gorup which is part of her exit package and shes raving about it. says you should look into it
2/22/2016~1:15 PM~13~2~1~Aru B~ called lee hect harrison
2/22/2016~1:15 PM~13~2~1~Aru B~ i used them before and didnt really get much out of them, but shes getting a lot out of it so might be worth looking into if its not too expensive
2/22/2016~1:56 PM~13~2~1~james e mooradian~ I'll look into it
2/22/2016~1:57 PM~13~2~1~james e mooradian~ Also I drank coffee this morning and I didn't think I was buzzed but I got up to shower and my legs and arms are shaking like crazy
2/22/2016~1:57 PM~13~2~1~james e mooradian~ I may have had a bit too much caffeine
2/22/2016~1:57 PM~13~2~1~Aru B~ Omg
2/22/2016~1:58 PM~13~2~1~Aru B~ Are u ok? Lol
2/22/2016~1:58 PM~13~2~1~james e mooradian~ No idea babes
2/22/2016~1:59 PM~13~2~1~james e mooradian~ I probably need to get rid of all this excess energy
2/22/2016~3:52 PM~15~2~1~james e mooradian~ So
2/22/2016~3:52 PM~15~2~1~james e mooradian~ Fun story
2/22/2016~3:53 PM~15~2~1~james e mooradian~ There was a mouse in the pizza box
2/22/2016~3:54 PM~15~2~1~james e mooradian~ I made a slightly unmanly sound when I was gathering some garbage together and a grey blur jumped out
2/22/2016~3:54 PM~15~2~1~james e mooradian~ In hindsight it was kinda cute, if scraggly looking
2/22/2016~3:55 PM~15~2~1~james e mooradian~ Just thought you might want to know and/or think about the type of mousetraps you want to order
2/22/2016~4:20 PM~16~2~1~Aru B~ U let it go?!
2/22/2016~4:20 PM~16~2~1~james e mooradian~ Baby I didn't know it was there
2/22/2016~4:20 PM~16~2~1~Aru B~ Lolol
2/22/2016~4:20 PM~16~2~1~james e mooradian~ It jumped out of the pizza box and ran like the dickens
2/22/2016~4:20 PM~16~2~1~Aru B~ I will prime now mousetraps
2/22/2016~4:20 PM~16~2~1~Aru B~ L.ao
2/22/2016~4:21 PM~16~2~1~Aru B~ Lmao*
2/22/2016~4:21 PM~16~2~1~james e mooradian~ It ran under the fridge but there's a good chance it's in the walls by npw
2/22/2016~4:21 PM~16~2~1~james e mooradian~ Either way I can't get at it
2/22/2016~4:26 PM~16~2~1~Aru B~ Which one should I get?
2/22/2016~4:26 PM~16~2~1~Aru B~ I don't want to see the mouse
2/22/2016~4:27 PM~16~2~1~james e mooradian~ Lol I dunno I was looking at the listings
2/22/2016~4:27 PM~16~2~1~james e mooradian~ I remember having ones that were enclosed back in lprraone
2/22/2016~4:27 PM~16~2~1~Aru B~ I already named him Hubert
2/22/2016~4:27 PM~16~2~1~Aru B~ I don't wanna see Hubert die
2/22/2016~4:28 PM~16~2~1~james e mooradian~ Probably not the best idea to name it of you're plan on killing
2/22/2016~4:28 PM~16~2~1~james e mooradian~ You can get the humane ones if you want
2/22/2016~4:28 PM~16~2~1~james e mooradian~ Not that there's really anywhere for a mouse to be released in manhattan
2/22/2016~4:28 PM~16~2~1~Aru B~ The trash chute
2/22/2016~4:29 PM~16~2~1~james e mooradian~ Well sure for a dead mouse
2/22/2016~4:29 PM~16~2~1~james e mooradian~ Not a live one
2/22/2016~4:30 PM~16~2~1~james e mooradian~ Oh by humane I meant nonlethal but yeah that too
2/22/2016~4:30 PM~16~2~1~james e mooradian~ You can get the ones that use electric shocks to kill
2/22/2016~4:30 PM~16~2~1~james e mooradian~ Your mouse is pretty small so I imagine that would work fine
2/22/2016~4:34 PM~16~2~1~james e mooradian~ http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00448MUVG/ref=psd_mlt_bc_B00448MUVG I think this is the one we had at my last place. It worked decently if you got a few and placed them around
2/22/2016~4:34 PM~16~2~1~james e mooradian~ Not sure if something else would be better
2/22/2016~4:35 PM~16~2~1~Aru B~ Ordered
2/22/2016~4:37 PM~16~2~1~Aru B~ I'm hungry again
2/22/2016~4:37 PM~16~2~1~Aru B~ Blah
2/22/2016~5:00 PM~17~2~1~james e mooradian~ I'm hungry too
2/22/2016~5:15 PM~17~2~1~james e mooradian~ I got my resume critique back, they didn't really like mine either
2/22/2016~5:16 PM~17~2~1~james e mooradian~ Said they didn't like the visual style and that I should focus more on achievements than tasks
2/22/2016~5:16 PM~17~2~1~james e mooradian~ But they thought I had experience in IT/data and somehow I also have 7 years of experience
2/22/2016~5:18 PM~17~2~1~Aru B~ that was my feedback
2/22/2016~5:18 PM~17~2~1~Aru B~ to the T
2/22/2016~5:18 PM~17~2~1~Aru B~ masters prob counts as experience
2/22/2016~5:19 PM~17~2~1~james e mooradian~ Sounds like it
2/22/2016~5:19 PM~17~2~1~james e mooradian~ I mean it was a free review
2/22/2016~5:19 PM~17~2~1~james e mooradian~ I'm guessing they spend probably 1-2 minutes tops going over the resume
2/22/2016~5:20 PM~17~2~1~james e mooradian~ Though maybe that's what makes the most sense
2/22/2016~5:20 PM~17~2~1~james e mooradian~ Oh also they showed a file size comparison and it seems like my resume is a small file compared to others
2/22/2016~5:20 PM~17~2~1~james e mooradian~ I don't know what that's supposed to imply tho if resumes are supposed to be 1 page
2/22/2016~5:26 PM~17~2~1~Aru B~ yeah
2/22/2016~5:26 PM~17~2~1~Aru B~ i didnt get that part either

3/1/2016~11:06 AM~11~3~2~Aru B~ 3. send them request to be friends
3/1/2016~11:07 AM~11~3~2~Aru B~ 3. once you send a request, send them a quick note telling them you want to chat about opportunites at their company
3/1/2016~11:07 AM~11~3~2~Aru B~ (knowing they have an open rec you can fill)
3/1/2016~11:07 AM~11~3~2~Aru B~ that's worked this am so far at one place
3/1/2016~11:07 AM~11~3~2~Aru B~ im gonna try my hand to see if it works elsewhere too

3/1/2016~11:08 AM~11~3~2~Aru B~ just to set up time
3/1/2016~11:08 AM~11~3~2~james e mooradian~ Seems risky man
3/1/2016~11:08 AM~11~3~2~Aru B~ nah
3/1/2016~11:08 AM~11~3~2~james e mooradian~ OK
3/1/2016~11:08 AM~11~3~2~Aru B~ i actually sent all the emails this am from home
3/1/2016~11:08 AM~11~3~2~Aru B~ before i went to work
3/1/2016~11:08 AM~11~3~2~Aru B~ and the guy emailed me back this am
3/1/2016~11:08 AM~11~3~2~Aru B~ so i just went to the bathroom and compiled a quick response
3/1/2016~11:09 AM~11~3~2~james e mooradian~ Ook
3/1/2016~11:09 AM~11~3~2~Aru B~ im not having conversations, just to set up some tme w/ them.
3/1/2016~11:10 AM~11~3~2~Aru B~ and then i'll prob go to some coffeeshop here and call them on my phone when the meetin gis set up
3/1/2016~11:10 AM~11~3~2~Aru B~ to chat
3/1/2016~11:10 AM~11~3~2~Aru B~ but apparently this works

3/1/2016~11:11 AM~11~3~2~Aru B~ Vaidu said your resume is good but too wordy. she also told me mine was too wordy.
3/1/2016~11:11 AM~11~3~2~Aru B~ so who knows
3/1/2016~11:11 AM~11~3~2~Aru B~ lol
3/1/2016~11:11 AM~11~3~2~james e mooradian~ I dunno
3/1/2016~11:11 AM~11~3~2~james e mooradian~ A lot of it is subjective
3/1/2016~11:12 AM~11~3~2~james e mooradian~ I thibk
3/1/2016~11:12 AM~11~3~2~Aru B~ yeah, but she makes good points
3/1/2016~11:12 AM~11~3~2~Aru B~ bc you scan a resume. if its too wordy you cant easily scan
3/1/2016~11:12 AM~11~3~2~Aru B~ so your stuff gets lost / you wont get picked up
3/1/2016~11:14 AM~11~3~2~Aru B~ i should probably go back to my six hour meeting today D:
3/1/2016~11:14 AM~11~3~2~Aru B~ so annoying.

3/3/2016~5:03 PM~17~3~4~Aru B~ He also said weird things like When I started he tried to mentor me, but stopped bc sarah called him  and told him to stop mentoring and if he wanted to continue he needed to go thru her

4/13/2016~5:02 PM~17~4~3~Aru B~ ps since i have it up, this is one unit we are seeing this weekend: http://streeteasy.com/building/1n4th-1-north-4-place-brooklyn/ph1b
4/13/2016~5:02 PM~17~4~3~Aru B~ i cant stay here for any longer tho
4/13/2016~5:02 PM~17~4~3~Aru B~ i just cant do it.
4/13/2016~5:02 PM~17~4~3~james e mooradian~ But there's a good chance they're just getting stuff ready
4/13/2016~5:03 PM~17~4~3~james e mooradian~ That's a nice place huns
4/13/2016~5:03 PM~17~4~3~james e mooradian~ But why
4/13/2016~5:03 PM~17~4~3~james e mooradian~ It's so expensive and it's in Williamsburg
4/13/2016~5:03 PM~17~4~3~Aru B~ bc its pretty and has all the ammenities we want
4/13/2016~5:04 PM~17~4~3~Aru B~ is that expensive? its 2500 but it has gym in building, laundry in unit so we wouldn't have any other expense except for interwebs and cable if we wants.
4/13/2016~5:05 PM~17~4~3~Aru B~ and its a month free so we could prob get the rent lower
4/13/2016~5:06 PM~17~4~3~Aru B~ sigh
4/13/2016~5:06 PM~17~4~3~Aru B~ i hate my life
4/13/2016~5:24 PM~17~4~3~james e mooradian~ I'm just comparing it to the really nice apt we saw back in Jan
4/13/2016~5:24 PM~17~4~3~james e mooradian~ It was cheaper than 2500pp
4/13/2016~5:25 PM~17~4~3~james e mooradian~ And it's in Manhattan, so most likely the places you want to go will be much closer
4/13/2016~5:25 PM~17~4~3~james e mooradian~ Seems like a waste to go to bk unless the apt really is super nicr
4/13/2016~5:25 PM~17~4~3~Aru B~ true. but this one didnt have that extra 60/month fee for gym, nor the laundry i'd have to pay for
4/13/2016~5:25 PM~17~4~3~james e mooradian~ I thought it had laundry in unit
4/13/2016~5:26 PM~17~4~3~Aru B~ the other one no
4/13/2016~5:26 PM~17~4~3~Aru B~ had a laundry room
4/13/2016~5:26 PM~17~4~3~james e mooradian~ I think we're talking about different ones
4/13/2016~5:26 PM~17~4~3~Aru B~ im talking about the one we almost got
4/13/2016~5:26 PM~17~4~3~Aru B~ im only comparing to that one
4/13/2016~5:26 PM~17~4~3~james e mooradian~ I was comparing to the one with the really nice view
4/13/2016~5:27 PM~17~4~3~james e mooradian~ My thought is you'll be more isolated in bk than where that one was
4/13/2016~5:27 PM~17~4~3~Aru B~ whic one w/ the reallynice view
4/13/2016~5:27 PM~17~4~3~james e mooradian~ But maybe there's more to do than I realize
4/13/2016~5:27 PM~17~4~3~Aru B~ the one we almost got but it fell thru right
4/13/2016~5:27 PM~17~4~3~james e mooradian~ No
4/13/2016~5:27 PM~17~4~3~Aru B~ the other one
4/13/2016~5:27 PM~17~4~3~Aru B~ with floor to ceiling windows?
4/13/2016~5:27 PM~17~4~3~james e mooradian~ The one that had the floor to ceiling windows
4/13/2016~5:27 PM~17~4~3~Aru B~ aha i see
4/13/2016~5:27 PM~17~4~3~Aru B~ this is true
4/13/2016~5:28 PM~17~4~3~james e mooradian~ Idk what stuff is around you
4/13/2016~5:28 PM~17~4~3~james e mooradian~ In bk
4/13/2016~5:28 PM~17~4~3~james e mooradian~ Maybe a lot

4/13/2016~5:54 PM~17~4~3~Aru B~ co-op?
4/13/2016~5:54 PM~17~4~3~Aru B~ i thought you were making chicken?

4/13/2016~6:58 PM~18~4~3~james e mooradian~ I just don't like meat in salads I make
4/13/2016~6:58 PM~18~4~3~james e mooradian~ Doesn't taste good versus fresh veggies
4/13/2016~6:58 PM~18~4~3~james e mooradian~ There was no avocado ripe enough to do the job

4/19/2016~1:15 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ and it bothers me
4/19/2016~1:19 PM~13~4~2~james e mooradian~ You guys should probably have a talk about what's going on
4/19/2016~1:19 PM~13~4~2~james e mooradian~ Kinda thought you would
4/19/2016~1:20 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ i have tried
4/19/2016~1:20 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ u have no idea
4/19/2016~1:20 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ -___-
4/19/2016~1:20 PM~13~4~2~james e mooradian~ It's gonna be hard to not lash out at each other like you did on sun
4/19/2016~1:20 PM~13~4~2~james e mooradian~ You gotta be able to shut that down on her end and your end
4/19/2016~1:20 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ but she insists that im in the wrong
4/19/2016~1:20 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ and i am not.
4/19/2016~1:21 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ lack of communication goes both ways, bruh
4/19/2016~1:21 PM~13~4~2~james e mooradian~ Yeah it does
4/19/2016~1:22 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ and the other hting is that she says she wants space
4/19/2016~1:22 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ but then kicks me out
4/19/2016~1:22 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ im going up to see you.
4/19/2016~1:22 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ where is her going to see my parents?
4/19/2016~1:22 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ why cant she make the effort to give me space?
4/19/2016~1:22 PM~13~4~2~james e mooradian~ Does she have ppl or places she can go to?
4/19/2016~1:23 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ she will say no. but i mean....she can at least just go home
4/19/2016~1:23 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ and then the final thing is that shes like oh i thought you were there to support me. like i dont have shit on my plate to just drop all my problems bc she needs me
4/19/2016~1:23 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ like ive been going thru shit since JANUARY
4/19/2016~1:23 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ shes been going thru it FOR A MONTH
4/19/2016~1:23 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ and she cant understand that?
4/19/2016~1:24 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ i even told her maybe weshouldnt live together
4/19/2016~1:24 PM~13~4~2~james e mooradian~ Maybe you can help her understand what's going on
4/19/2016~1:24 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ and she was like yeah maybe we souldnt
4/19/2016~1:24 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ but that was just spiteful
4/19/2016~1:24 PM~13~4~2~james e mooradian~ But like
4/19/2016~1:24 PM~13~4~2~james e mooradian~ Did you bring it up as a discussion or was it like an attack
4/19/2016~1:24 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ i just want this stupid apartment thing to go thru
4/19/2016~1:25 PM~13~4~2~james e mooradian~ And what about her end
4/19/2016~1:25 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ i just said it while we were on the topic
4/19/2016~1:25 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ and she lashed out saying it spitefully
4/19/2016~1:25 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ and the other thing is that she is comparing herself to me
4/19/2016~1:26 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ and thinks that orchard is a more stable company that hightower.
4/19/2016~1:26 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ so she feels like shes at the shitty end of the stick
4/19/2016~1:26 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ and the fact that saad told her she made the wrong decision
4/19/2016~1:26 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ shes of course now thinking she made the wrong call too
4/19/2016~1:26 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ bc thats what saad told her.
4/19/2016~1:26 PM~13~4~2~james e mooradian~ Jesus
4/19/2016~1:26 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ like she makes decisions, then lashes out at me when she doesnt like them?
4/19/2016~1:26 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ at least own up to it
4/19/2016~1:27 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ and its not even a month in
4/19/2016~1:27 PM~13~4~2~james e mooradian~ I mean I wouldn't get up on your high horse about that tho
4/19/2016~1:27 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ shes just not giving it a chance
4/19/2016~1:27 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ rushing to conclusions
4/19/2016~1:27 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ and its making her miserable
4/19/2016~1:28 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ shes been telling me how she has to work harder there bc the technology doesnt come to her as easily as blk did (bc she knew the technology here at blk really well). and how shes not being onboarded or trained correctly
4/19/2016~1:28 PM~13~4~2~james e mooradian~ It's useful to get some distance to gain perspective but also incredibly hard
4/19/2016~1:28 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ and im thinking that this is how it is when ur not part of a program
4/19/2016~1:28 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ but im not going to just say thats how i felt in every one of my jobs
4/19/2016~1:28 PM~13~4~2~Aru B~ im just going to be ike oh, well try to reach out to the right people i guess to get urself up to speed
4/19/2016~1:29 PM~13~4~2~james e mooradian~ So much drama man

5/12/2016~12:29 PM~12~5~4~Aru B~ And we're trying to figure out what happened. All we know is that she's been in hospital and police station all day, is going home soon
5/12/2016~12:29 PM~12~5~4~james e mooradian~ Is she okay
5/12/2016~12:29 PM~12~5~4~james e mooradian~ Holy shit
5/12/2016~12:29 PM~12~5~4~Aru B~ She was taking the subway back at 2:30 am from manhattan to bumblefuck Brooklyn
5/12/2016~12:29 PM~12~5~4~Aru B~ She fell asleep
5/12/2016~12:29 PM~12~5~4~Aru B~ Woke up to a fucking hipster forcing himself in her mouth
5/12/2016~12:29 PM~12~5~4~james e mooradian~ Shit
5/12/2016~12:29 PM~12~5~4~Aru B~ She confronted him, he assisted her and busted her lip
5/12/2016~12:30 PM~12~5~4~Aru B~ No idea where Ilya was, why she was alone that late, etc.
5/12/2016~12:30 PM~12~5~4~Aru B~ I told her to go home get some sleep and then call me and I'll go over there ASAP.
5/12/2016~12:30 PM~12~5~4~james e mooradian~ Yeah
5/12/2016~12:30 PM~12~5~4~Aru B~ She also said not to tell anyone bc she's still processing it but Beata already told Greg so it's only a matter of time until I told u
5/12/2016~12:31 PM~12~5~4~james e mooradian~ I won't tell anybody
5/12/2016~12:32 PM~12~5~4~james e mooradian~ But yeah that's not an easy thing to go through
5/12/2016~12:32 PM~12~5~4~Aru B~ But seriously, I'm silently raging all day. Where was Ilya? Why did he let her go home alone that late at night? What was she doing out?
5/12/2016~12:33 PM~12~5~4~Aru B~ So she's hopped up on a ton of meds, gave her std and hiv drugs etc. the guy got away as far as I know.
5/12/2016~12:33 PM~12~5~4~Aru B~ The police were really nice to her too so that was good
5/12/2016~12:35 PM~12~5~4~james e mooradian~ Damn
5/12/2016~12:35 PM~12~5~4~james e mooradian~ They don't have any cameras on the subway?
5/12/2016~12:35 PM~12~5~4~Aru B~ They do but I guess he wore a hoodie?
5/12/2016~12:36 PM~12~5~4~Aru B~ It was some freaking hipster too. RAAAAGE
5/12/2016~12:39 PM~12~5~4~Aru B~ Sigh. And on top of this my moms being weird today. So all around stellar day. But my mom thing seems so trivial now
5/12/2016~12:39 PM~12~5~4~james e mooradian~ Yeah serioualy
5/12/2016~12:40 PM~12~5~4~james e mooradian~ I would make sure saskia has someone to help her through this stuff
5/12/2016~12:40 PM~12~5~4~Aru B~ I already offered, and I told her to call me when she's awake
5/12/2016~12:41 PM~12~5~4~james e mooradian~ That's good
5/12/2016~12:41 PM~12~5~4~Aru B~ I'll tell Vaidu to reach out to her and give her the name of her therapist in case she wants to go that route
5/12/2016~12:41 PM~12~5~4~james e mooradian~ That's good
5/12/2016~12:41 PM~12~5~4~james e mooradian~ Does she have someone to spend time with her now?
5/12/2016~12:42 PM~12~5~4~Aru B~ Idk. I offered and she said she just wanted to sleep, she'd been awake for about 30 hrs or so
5/12/2016~12:42 PM~12~5~4~Aru B~ And said she just wanted to get some sleep
5/12/2016~12:42 PM~12~5~4~Aru B~ So I'll give her a call later
5/12/2016~12:42 PM~12~5~4~james e mooradian~ Sounds like a decent plan

5/13/2016~10:24 AM~10~5~5~james e mooradian~ That is a really weird segway to make
5/13/2016~10:25 AM~10~5~5~james e mooradian~ We should maybe not discuss it through text messaging I think
5/13/2016~10:25 AM~10~5~5~Aru B~ Okay
5/13/2016~10:26 AM~10~5~5~Aru B~ I just took a hot shower and came to the decision that the easiest thing is to just dump everyone and run away from my problems. So here I am, running away.
5/13/2016~10:28 AM~10~5~5~james e mooradian~ You can't run away from your problems bro
5/13/2016~10:28 AM~10~5~5~james e mooradian~ They're the only things you take with you when you run
5/13/2016~10:29 AM~10~5~5~Aru B~ U can if u try hard enough
5/13/2016~10:30 AM~10~5~5~james e mooradian~ Also on my way home from work yesterday a bird took a crap and it landed on my neck in between the back of my neck and my shirt and I had to walk to my car and drive home with bird shit all over my neck and shirt

5/13/2016~10:30 AM~10~5~5~Aru B~ Isn't that supposed to be good luck tho
5/13/2016~10:30 AM~10~5~5~james e mooradian~ It was probably the most disgusting thing that's happened to me in a while and I thought you would appreciate it

5/13/2016~10:31 AM~10~5~5~james e mooradian~ Like what are the odds of the poo landing right on the back of my neck
5/13/2016~10:31 AM~10~5~5~Aru B~ Exactly. Very small odds. Aka YAY U WERE THE CHOSEN ONE
5/13/2016~10:32 AM~10~5~5~Aru B~ Maybe the bird picked u from a distance
5/13/2016~10:32 AM~10~5~5~james e mooradian~ Lol we see this situation very differently
5/13/2016~10:32 AM~10~5~5~Aru B~ And flew above u while it's shit was a brewing

6/5/2016~6:52 PM~18~6~7~Aru B~ and some stuff for dinner
6/5/2016~9:10 PM~21~6~7~Aru B~ So I think we can take a later flight down
6/5/2016~9:10 PM~21~6~7~Aru B~ Check in isn't until 3pm
6/5/2016~9:10 PM~21~6~7~Aru B~ So we should grab the 1:50 flight
6/5/2016~9:12 PM~21~6~7~Aru B~ No sense in getting there that far before check-in
6/5/2016~10:08 PM~22~6~7~Aru B~ also i havent had a chance to get any furniture
6/5/2016~10:08 PM~22~6~7~Aru B~ so idk whats going on

6/6/2016~9:55 AM~9~6~1~Aru B~ and i cant wait to see you soon
6/6/2016~3:03 PM~15~6~1~james e mooradian~ Hey huns I'm sorry I was so short yesterday
6/6/2016~3:03 PM~15~6~1~james e mooradian~ I was getting frustrated from working the other day and I ended up getting on the phone with George just before you called
6/6/2016~3:04 PM~15~6~1~james e mooradian~ I'm excited to see you hunnigans
6/6/2016~3:04 PM~15~6~1~james e mooradian~ Also I would recommend looking directly on chase.com if you can for flights
6/6/2016~3:05 PM~15~6~1~james e mooradian~ United is not the fanciest airline but I found a round-trip for 44k points or $550 or some combo of the two
6/6/2016~3:05 PM~15~6~1~james e mooradian~ Apparently chase has the highest ROR on united and Southwest
6/6/2016~3:06 PM~15~6~1~james e mooradian~ It's UA1586 out and UA1587 back
6/6/2016~3:08 PM~15~6~1~Aru B~ That's what I was doing, was directly on chase last night
6/6/2016~3:08 PM~15~6~1~james e mooradian~ I see
6/6/2016~3:08 PM~15~6~1~Aru B~ It's fine, I'd rather you just tell me next time you're busy and that nows not a good time instead of just dealing with me and being short.
6/6/2016~3:10 PM~15~6~1~Aru B~ And on my part i can begin each call with "is now a good time to chat" if that would help as well
6/6/2016~3:10 PM~15~6~1~Aru B~ I don't care what flight we take as long as checked luggage is free
6/6/2016~3:10 PM~15~6~1~Aru B~ We check in at 3 so I think it makes the most sense to land around then so we can get to the resort after 3
6/6/2016~3:11 PM~15~6~1~Aru B~ And since its sat to sat when we come back doesn't matter, our apt is open for both u and Emily until Sunday in case we get in late and you'd like to just travel back up on Sunday
6/6/2016~3:12 PM~15~6~1~Aru B~ Also that was the round trip deal I was getting with JetBlue on chase
6/6/2016~6:23 PM~18~6~1~Aru B~ Hi I need advice for like 2 quick seconds
6/6/2016~6:24 PM~18~6~1~Aru B~ What's a good cut of beef to get for stir fries

6/22/2016~12:19 PM~12~6~3~Aru B~ If you have a blue one that would work well w/ lighter shirts
6/22/2016~12:19 PM~12~6~3~Aru B~ A khaki would go well w/ darker or more colorful shirts
6/22/2016~12:19 PM~12~6~3~Aru B~ I know I don't like khakis but they would match
6/22/2016~12:21 PM~12~6~3~james e mooradian~ Yeah I'm avoiding khakis cos I know you don't like them

6/22/2016~12:22 PM~12~6~3~Aru B~ A light grey would work similarly

7/11/2016~3:28 PM~15~7~1~Aru B~ from having an air, i'd say the price increase to get a lightweight laptop is worth it
7/11/2016~3:31 PM~15~7~1~Aru B~ esp with the amount you travel, i'd say it should be a priority for you. you wont understand how great it is until u get a thinner laptop.
7/11/2016~3:32 PM~15~7~1~james e mooradian~ I don't know if the HP has enough power
7/11/2016~3:32 PM~15~7~1~james e mooradian~ But I'm gonna keep looking

7/11/2016~3:33 PM~15~7~1~Aru B~ doesnt have to be that. im just saying i think it would benefit you to see that as a necessary spec, thats all.

7/13/2016~3:59 PM~15~7~3~james e mooradian~ ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡
7/13/2016~4:01 PM~16~7~3~james e mooradian~ <Media omitted>
7/13/2016~4:03 PM~16~7~3~Aru B~ Damn
7/13/2016~4:04 PM~16~7~3~james e mooradian~ I literally have no idea how I'm supposed to get usable numbers by then
7/13/2016~4:04 PM~16~7~3~james e mooradian~ They'll have next to no qaqc
7/13/2016~4:05 PM~16~7~3~Aru B~ I would have cced his boss on that email
7/13/2016~4:05 PM~16~7~3~james e mooradian~ He just went on vacation today...
7/13/2016~4:06 PM~16~7~3~Aru B~ And had been like hi it's a little late for y to tell me now how long did u know about this
7/13/2016~4:06 PM~16~7~3~Aru B~ Still
7/13/2016~4:06 PM~16~7~3~james e mooradian~ I feel like this is calculated
7/13/2016~4:06 PM~16~7~3~Aru B~ So he knows when he gets back
7/13/2016~4:06 PM~16~7~3~Aru B~ It probably is
7/13/2016~4:06 PM~16~7~3~james e mooradian~ He knew about this but I guess he assumed the info would have made it to me sooner? Idk
7/13/2016~4:06 PM~16~7~3~Aru B~ Does he have to do anything once u give him those numbers
7/13/2016~4:06 PM~16~7~3~james e mooradian~ Yeah
7/13/2016~4:06 PM~16~7~3~james e mooradian~ Lots of shit
7/13/2016~4:07 PM~16~7~3~Aru B~ I would set up a meeting with his boss and him
7/13/2016~4:07 PM~16~7~3~Aru B~ And be like listen, we have to work together but fucking hell stop being such a bad employee
7/13/2016~4:07 PM~16~7~3~Aru B~ He's tying to pin his negligence on u
7/13/2016~4:07 PM~16~7~3~Aru B~ So he can have an out. "Jimmy didn't get me the numbers in time!"
7/13/2016~4:07 PM~16~7~3~james e mooradian~ He's always comes back weeks later and says different shit
7/13/2016~4:08 PM~16~7~3~Aru B~ Well u have documentation
7/13/2016~4:08 PM~16~7~3~james e mooradian~ No I mean the higher ups know how good I am
7/13/2016~4:08 PM~16~7~3~james e mooradian~ It just gives me shitty stressful situations in the interim
7/13/2016~4:09 PM~16~7~3~james e mooradian~ He's just not good at managing
7/13/2016~4:09 PM~16~7~3~Aru B~ There's an easy way to out politic him
7/13/2016~4:09 PM~16~7~3~james e mooradian~ I feel like the office tries hard to prop people up like that
7/13/2016~4:09 PM~16~7~3~james e mooradian~ Which is fine but it tends to breed incomplete
7/13/2016~4:09 PM~16~7~3~james e mooradian~ Incompetence*
7/13/2016~4:09 PM~16~7~3~Aru B~ Dude go over his head
7/13/2016~4:09 PM~16~7~3~Aru B~ Send an email to his boss
7/13/2016~4:09 PM~16~7~3~james e mooradian~ He is on vacation bro
7/13/2016~4:10 PM~16~7~3~Aru B~ Yes
7/13/2016~4:10 PM~16~7~3~Aru B~ I'd still send the email
7/13/2016~4:12 PM~16~7~3~Aru B~ Is there any way u can get it done
7/13/2016~4:12 PM~16~7~3~Aru B~ And send it to him right before the meeting
7/13/2016~4:12 PM~16~7~3~Aru B~ So he has no time to do his shit? Are u in this meeting?
7/13/2016~4:13 PM~16~7~3~james e mooradian~ I don't think so
7/13/2016~4:13 PM~16~7~3~james e mooradian~ I honestly wouldn't be surprised if I was though and he just didn't tell me
7/13/2016~4:17 PM~16~7~3~Aru B~ Sounds like he forgot, realized he forgot and was like welp I'll just email Jimmy once my boss isn't here
7/13/2016~4:17 PM~16~7~3~james e mooradian~ Idk I just dont
7/13/2016~4:18 PM~16~7~3~james e mooradian~ I've been teaching a new modeler with this project

7/13/2016~4:19 PM~16~7~3~james e mooradian~ And then yell at him and my boss for being fucking morons
7/13/2016~4:19 PM~16~7~3~james e mooradian~ Imo his boss is just as much at fault for this
7/13/2016~4:19 PM~16~7~3~james e mooradian~ He should have told the client that it's 3 weeks early on a 7 week project
7/13/2016~4:20 PM~16~7~3~james e mooradian~ So no way
7/13/2016~4:20 PM~16~7~3~james e mooradian~ Barring that he should have told me about this directly

8/17/2016~1:23 PM~13~8~3~Aru B~ i liked it, whichever one you think she will use more
8/17/2016~1:23 PM~13~8~3~james e mooradian~ Okay. I'm thinking she would probably use the purse more but idk
8/17/2016~1:24 PM~13~8~3~james e mooradian~ She doesn't travel a ton except her drives up to Stamford once or twice per year
8/17/2016~1:24 PM~13~8~3~Aru B~ they are just nice pouches
8/17/2016~1:24 PM~13~8~3~Aru B~ doesnt have to be for travel
8/17/2016~1:24 PM~13~8~3~Aru B~ can help her organize her purse, etc. or put her makeup in there, or whatever
8/17/2016~1:25 PM~13~8~3~Aru B~ if u think she will use the bag more, get that.
8/17/2016~1:25 PM~13~8~3~james e mooradian~ Right right
8/17/2016~1:25 PM~13~8~3~Aru B~ its just a nice quality w/ a great price point and you get it engraved
8/17/2016~1:25 PM~13~8~3~james e mooradian~ Okay yeah
8/17/2016~1:25 PM~13~8~3~james e mooradian~ You're right
8/17/2016~1:25 PM~13~8~3~james e mooradian~ I think the pouches are a little more personal
8/17/2016~1:25 PM~13~8~3~james e mooradian~ Any pref on color?
8/17/2016~1:26 PM~13~8~3~Aru B~ whats her favorite color?
8/17/2016~1:26 PM~13~8~3~james e mooradian~ Ummm
8/17/2016~1:26 PM~13~8~3~james e mooradian~ Possibly green
8/17/2016~1:26 PM~13~8~3~Aru B~ if she likes bright colors then the blue or teal
8/17/2016~1:27 PM~13~8~3~james e mooradian~ The purse I've seen her carry around is a light brown color kinda like your largish bag
8/17/2016~1:28 PM~13~8~3~Aru B~ well it goes in the bag
8/17/2016~1:28 PM~13~8~3~Aru B~ so she can either match it
8/17/2016~1:28 PM~13~8~3~Aru B~ OR she can just have a bright pop of color
8/17/2016~1:29 PM~13~8~3~Aru B~ for COLOR the blue, red or pistachio are pretty
8/17/2016~1:29 PM~13~8~3~Aru B~ to match the grey, stone,  ecru, blush or olive
8/17/2016~1:30 PM~13~8~3~Aru B~ wouldnt matter too much. i dont really know your moms well....but something is telling me the blue or teal would be good for her
8/17/2016~1:32 PM~13~8~3~Aru B~ the pearl grey is nice
8/17/2016~1:32 PM~13~8~3~Aru B~ the inside of that matches the outside of your moms bag
8/17/2016~1:32 PM~13~8~3~Aru B~ and can match any other color bag or more less
8/17/2016~1:55 PM~13~8~3~james e mooradian~ I'm asking Bruce if he knows what color her bag is
8/17/2016~1:55 PM~13~8~3~james e mooradian~ I'll order based on that and your advice

8/18/2016~10:24 AM~10~8~4~Aru B~ He's reached out to her and i think she wants to know if she should mention you or not in a response
8/18/2016~10:26 AM~10~8~4~james e mooradian~ I was gonna msg you this morning actually. There's no description of the position in the e-mail
8/18/2016~10:26 AM~10~8~4~james e mooradian~ Or the company
8/18/2016~10:27 AM~10~8~4~Aru B~ That's why I chatted you a link to it here

8/18/2016~10:33 AM~10~8~4~james e mooradian~ I don't fit any of the qualifications dealing with finance/marketing but I guess that doesn't matter at all
8/18/2016~10:34 AM~10~8~4~Aru B~ Well if it's not what u want to do then u can let me know and I'll tell Beata not to push it
8/18/2016~10:35 AM~10~8~4~james e mooradian~ Nah it's fine. I'll email the recruiter.

8/24/2016~3:29 PM~15~8~3~james e mooradian~ I thought that was only something that described IDEs like jupyter
8/24/2016~3:30 PM~15~8~3~james e mooradian~ 'The world "agnostic" is derived from the ancient Greek for "don't know".'
8/24/2016~3:31 PM~15~8~3~james e mooradian~ I realize the phrase doesn't mean that, but I can't help but love the irony of telling someone you're agnostic

8/28/2016~11:08 AM~11~8~7~james e mooradian~ I'm surprised that beata hangout isn't taking place outside of NYC
8/28/2016~11:08 AM~11~8~7~Aru B~ Huh?
8/28/2016~11:08 AM~11~8~7~Aru B~ It is outside of nyc. It's somewhere upstate
8/28/2016~11:09 AM~11~8~7~james e mooradian~ Oh okay I sort of thought you implied the hangout would also be in the city
8/28/2016~11:09 AM~11~8~7~Aru B~ No I meant I don't want to hang with stelios but I also wanted to get out of the city
8/28/2016~11:09 AM~11~8~7~Aru B~ And since we're seeing Emily and company the weekend after
8/28/2016~11:10 AM~11~8~7~Aru B~ I figured it would be the lesser of two evils

8/28/2016~11:46 AM~11~8~7~james e mooradian~ That's a good idea
8/28/2016~11:47 AM~11~8~7~james e mooradian~ You should check standard rentals as well depending on how long youre gonna stay
8/28/2016~11:47 AM~11~8~7~Aru B~ It's so expensive gonna be like 200 pp for the two of us to just rent
8/28/2016~11:47 AM~11~8~7~james e mooradian~ I think standard rentals are better if you have them for a few days in a row
8/28/2016~11:47 AM~11~8~7~james e mooradian~ Oh nm that's strange
8/28/2016~11:48 AM~11~8~7~Aru B~ Yeah I'll check

8/31/2016~1:49 PM~13~8~3~Aru B~ Sounds like he needs the official seal or approval to hire someone but doesn't have the time to fully interview

9/8/2016~10:50 AM~10~9~4~james e mooradian~ Ppl are implying there's no audio jack or that it's not a standard jack
9/8/2016~10:51 AM~10~9~4~Aru B~ still don't get it.
9/8/2016~10:52 AM~10~9~4~james e mooradian~ http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/iphone-7-headphone-jack-the-story-so-far-1324866
9/8/2016~10:52 AM~10~9~4~james e mooradian~ The new iPhone doesn't have an audio jacl
9/8/2016~10:52 AM~10~9~4~Aru B~ new iPhone doesn't have an audio jack
9/8/2016~10:52 AM~10~9~4~james e mooradian~ Jack"
9/8/2016~10:52 AM~10~9~4~james e mooradian~ Lol
9/8/2016~10:52 AM~10~9~4~Aru B~ yes
9/8/2016~10:52 AM~10~9~4~Aru B~ and?
9/8/2016~10:52 AM~10~9~4~james e mooradian~ Why bro
9/8/2016~10:53 AM~10~9~4~Aru B~ bc to make it thinner they had to get rid of it
9/8/2016~10:53 AM~10~9~4~james e mooradian~ So no headphones?
9/8/2016~10:53 AM~10~9~4~Aru B~ u either get wireless headphones which connect via bluetooth
9/8/2016~10:53 AM~10~9~4~Aru B~ get their new headphones w/ the lighting jack
9/8/2016~10:53 AM~10~9~4~Aru B~ OR u get the 8$ adapter
9/8/2016~10:54 AM~10~9~4~Aru B~ I'm betting the next years version will have wireless charging so this is just the mid-step to that
9/8/2016~10:54 AM~10~9~4~james e mooradian~ Lightning jack probably has the fastest charging capability atm
9/8/2016~10:55 AM~10~9~4~james e mooradian~ Just seems terribly inconvenient
9/8/2016~10:55 AM~10~9~4~Aru B~ it feels like an incomplete phone relesae
9/8/2016~10:55 AM~10~9~4~Aru B~ but they are saving the cool stuff for next yr bc its the 10th anniversary

9/9/2016~3:30 PM~15~9~5~Aru B~ and i know this would be a complete surprise for Vaidu and something she would LOVE
9/9/2016~3:30 PM~15~9~5~Aru B~ and after her year, i think 200 is fine, right?
9/9/2016~3:30 PM~15~9~5~james e mooradian~ Yeah I feel like that would be pretty good
9/9/2016~3:30 PM~15~9~5~Aru B~ we had set a limit of 150 for each other
9/9/2016~3:30 PM~15~9~5~Aru B~ its oct 7th

9/9/2016~3:32 PM~15~9~5~Aru B~ instead of being on the floor and we are short so we might not even get a good view

9/16/2016~12:46 PM~12~9~5~james e mooradian~ She just left for the gym
9/16/2016~12:46 PM~12~9~5~james e mooradian~ Why do you ask
9/16/2016~12:47 PM~12~9~5~Aru B~ she mentioned she hasn't heard from saad
9/16/2016~12:47 PM~12~9~5~Aru B~ and asked if she should reach out
9/16/2016~12:48 PM~12~9~5~Aru B~ saskia mentioned that she thinks he is ghosting her out. hajj has been over since the 11th.
9/16/2016~12:48 PM~12~9~5~Aru B~ eid is over.
9/16/2016~12:48 PM~12~9~5~Aru B~ if he wanted to contact her, he would.
9/16/2016~12:48 PM~12~9~5~Aru B~ i think sas was a bit harsh, but she's just worried and thinks that avid waiting around for saad to reach out is unhealthy
9/16/2016~12:49 PM~12~9~5~Aru B~ vaidu*
9/16/2016~12:52 PM~12~9~5~james e mooradian~ I suppose
9/16/2016~1:02 PM~13~9~5~Aru B~ i dunno whats your take?
9/16/2016~1:03 PM~13~9~5~Aru B~ would you go 5 days without any communication if you were accompanying your dad somewhere knowing that you chose him over me and knowing that we'd probably break up after?
9/16/2016~1:34 PM~13~9~5~james e mooradian~ I really don't know. I'm not going through what he is, and I don't think I communicate like he does
9/16/2016~1:35 PM~13~9~5~james e mooradian~ It doesn't seem like it's going to work though
9/16/2016~1:35 PM~13~9~5~james e mooradian~ Is he back from the trip?
9/16/2016~1:36 PM~13~9~5~james e mooradian~ I feel like his dad probably would have done something significant during/after the hajj
9/16/2016~1:36 PM~13~9~5~Aru B~ He's done with hajj
9/16/2016~1:36 PM~13~9~5~Aru B~ But dunno where he is
9/16/2016~1:37 PM~13~9~5~james e mooradian~ Seems like it would be symbolic for his dad for one reason or another
9/16/2016~1:37 PM~13~9~5~james e mooradian~ No idea
9/16/2016~2:44 PM~14~9~5~Aru B~ thank you for being awesome babers

10/4/2016~5:16 PM~17~10~2~Aru B~ *Historians often make this distinction that Oct 26th has the same amount of #blessed as Oct 22nd per capita, but since there are two holy births on the 22nd vs 1 on the 26th, Oct 22nd comes in as the holiest day.

10/5/2016~10:45 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ and the tech guy said that its bc my resolution isn't the native resolution
10/5/2016~10:45 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ and thats why i'll have problems.
10/5/2016~10:45 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ does that make any sense?
10/5/2016~10:45 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ i have it scaled back
10/5/2016~10:46 AM~10~10~3~james e mooradian~ Yeah
10/5/2016~10:46 AM~10~10~3~james e mooradian~ That makes sense

10/5/2016~10:46 AM~10~10~3~james e mooradian~ That's resolution
10/5/2016~10:46 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ how do i find it out?
10/5/2016~10:47 AM~10~10~3~james e mooradian~ Aspect would be like 4x3 or 16x9
10/5/2016~10:47 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ oh
10/5/2016~10:47 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ idk
10/5/2016~10:47 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ but like, i don't want my icons and stuff to be that large
10/5/2016~10:47 AM~10~10~3~james e mooradian~ Whatismyresolution.com
10/5/2016~10:47 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ idk why the monitor wont work properly if i make it smaller
10/5/2016~10:48 AM~10~10~3~james e mooradian~ Idk if it works properly for multiple monitors
10/5/2016~10:48 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ 2560x1440
10/5/2016~10:48 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ its only one monitor
10/5/2016~10:48 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ i don't have mutlile
10/5/2016~10:48 AM~10~10~3~james e mooradian~ That could just be the setting u have it on
10/5/2016~10:48 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ aspect ratio is 16:9
10/5/2016~10:48 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ setting? what could just be the setting?
10/5/2016~10:49 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ i don't understand why, with expensive monitors, i cant customize it without having issues
10/5/2016~10:49 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ that doesn't make any sense to me.
10/5/2016~10:49 AM~10~10~3~james e mooradian~ I don't know much about Mac displays
10/5/2016~10:49 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ its a dell
10/5/2016~10:49 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ my monitor
10/5/2016~10:49 AM~10~10~3~james e mooradian~ Are u using a Mac OS with the display?
10/5/2016~10:49 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ yes
10/5/2016~10:50 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ but why would that matter
10/5/2016~10:50 AM~10~10~3~james e mooradian~ The Mac's video card and os are the ones configuring the data to be displayed on the monitor
10/5/2016~10:51 AM~10~10~3~james e mooradian~ Idk much about compatibility
10/5/2016~10:51 AM~10~10~3~james e mooradian~ It's probably fine but I would use the resolution that requires the least amount of calculation on the monitor end
10/5/2016~10:52 AM~10~10~3~james e mooradian~ The video card on your MacBook can handle it most lilely
10/5/2016~10:52 AM~10~10~3~james e mooradian~ Unless it's damaged
10/5/2016~10:52 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ the native resolution makes the shit on my dell huge like i have a reading disability
10/5/2016~10:52 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ and cant afford glasses
10/5/2016~10:52 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ but if i change it apparently the monitor cant handle it
10/5/2016~10:52 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ and i swear that no-one else's is this large
10/5/2016~10:53 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ so i don't understand why im being told that its wrong and to expect a monitor to malfunction.
10/5/2016~10:53 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ isn't technology supposed to make ur life easier?
10/5/2016~10:53 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ lol
10/5/2016~10:53 AM~10~10~3~james e mooradian~ I don't get why the higher resolution would make text n shit smaller
10/5/2016~10:53 AM~10~10~3~james e mooradian~ Or other way around sorry
10/5/2016~10:53 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ its scaled
10/5/2016~10:53 AM~10~10~3~james e mooradian~ Higher resolution=small text
10/5/2016~10:53 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ system preferences > displays
10/5/2016~10:53 AM~10~10~3~james e mooradian~ Don't scale it as much?
10/5/2016~10:54 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ im working on a 1280 x 900 now

10/5/2016~10:54 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ <Media omitted>
10/5/2016~10:55 AM~10~10~3~james e mooradian~ Is that small for you?

10/5/2016~10:58 AM~10~10~3~james e mooradian~ I would just do that to give it the benefit of the doubt
10/5/2016~10:58 AM~10~10~3~james e mooradian~ If it's still giving you black screen issues the monitor or the video card is bad
10/5/2016~10:58 AM~10~10~3~james e mooradian~ Or you need a firmware update
10/5/2016~10:58 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ you would just do what
10/5/2016~10:59 AM~10~10~3~james e mooradian~ Just try the native res for a day or two and see if you still get black screen issies
10/5/2016~10:59 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ but its too big
10/5/2016~10:59 AM~10~10~3~Aru B~ *Rips out hair*

10/5/2016~11:06 AM~11~10~3~james e mooradian~ I'm finally at a point where I get too many emails to just have the one inbox
10/5/2016~11:06 AM~11~10~3~Aru B~ i have lots of folders and auto routing set up
10/5/2016~11:06 AM~11~10~3~Aru B~ based on products/projects
10/5/2016~11:06 AM~11~10~3~james e mooradian~ I wanted to figure out the auto routing
10/5/2016~11:06 AM~11~10~3~james e mooradian~ I wasn't sure if was a learning algo or if you had to set up specific keywords
10/5/2016~11:07 AM~11~10~3~james e mooradian~ Or if you just had to manually sort shit
10/5/2016~11:07 AM~11~10~3~Aru B~ you set routing rules
10/5/2016~11:07 AM~11~10~3~james e mooradian~ I imagine Gmail has a learning algo but idk about outlook
10/5/2016~11:07 AM~11~10~3~Aru B~ outlook does too
10/5/2016~11:07 AM~11~10~3~Aru B~ you're way behind the times
10/5/2016~11:07 AM~11~10~3~Aru B~ i had it all set up at blk
10/5/2016~11:07 AM~11~10~3~Aru B~ routed to whichever folder
10/5/2016~11:07 AM~11~10~3~Aru B~ worked 99% of the time
10/5/2016~12:01 PM~12~10~3~james e mooradian~ I don't see anything on learning algo for folder sorting
10/5/2016~12:01 PM~12~10~3~james e mooradian~ I only see these rules
10/5/2016~12:02 PM~12~10~3~Aru B~ You set rules
10/5/2016~12:02 PM~12~10~3~Aru B~ Idk where ur getting learning also from
10/5/2016~12:02 PM~12~10~3~james e mooradian~ Gmail has one
10/5/2016~12:03 PM~12~10~3~james e mooradian~ It rolled it out first for primary vs social vs promotion
10/5/2016~12:03 PM~12~10~3~james e mooradian~ Idk how advanced it has gotten since
10/5/2016~12:03 PM~12~10~3~james e mooradian~ NLP bro

10/5/2016~12:06 PM~12~10~3~james e mooradian~ I have overlapping teams for projects and they don't always label emails with the project route
10/5/2016~12:06 PM~12~10~3~Aru B~ Yeah I mean u can layer them
10/5/2016~12:06 PM~12~10~3~Aru B~ And have keywords in the body of the email that will route
10/5/2016~12:06 PM~12~10~3~Aru B~ Instead of the title
10/5/2016~12:07 PM~12~10~3~james e mooradian~ I did

10/17/2016~3:59 PM~15~10~1~Aru B~ that she has a problem w/ me but wont just tell me so we can hash it out. she'd rather just ignore it instead
10/17/2016~5:08 PM~17~10~1~james e mooradian~ ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜
10/17/2016~5:08 PM~17~10~1~Aru B~ apparently i have changed since vaidu moved

10/17/2016~5:09 PM~17~10~1~Aru B~ and she didnt want to say anything bc <insert some bs excuse here>
10/17/2016~5:09 PM~17~10~1~james e mooradian~ She prob doesn't understand the context or something
10/17/2016~5:09 PM~17~10~1~james e mooradian~ ðŸ˜ðŸ˜‘
10/17/2016~5:09 PM~17~10~1~Aru B~ its the weirdest thing
10/17/2016~5:09 PM~17~10~1~Aru B~ why throw it in my face now while arguing instead of telling me that ur concerned?
10/17/2016~5:11 PM~17~10~1~james e mooradian~ And after a pretty lengthy talk about how were new Yorkers and are pretty confrontational by nature
10/17/2016~5:11 PM~17~10~1~james e mooradian~ But I mean maybe it's tougher with friends bcos you're more concerned about their feelings
10/17/2016~5:11 PM~17~10~1~Aru B~ omg i didnt even catch that. ðŸ˜‚ she was telling vaidu this, i just had vaidu tell her to talk to me
10/17/2016~5:12 PM~17~10~1~james e mooradian~ ðŸ˜¬
10/17/2016~5:12 PM~17~10~1~james e mooradian~ Also I gotta say

10/17/2016~5:13 PM~17~10~1~james e mooradian~ She could srsly have a (admittedly less lucrative) career as a comedienne

10/17/2016~5:24 PM~17~10~1~james e mooradian~ I didn't get to pet the pupper because I was preoccupied with something
10/17/2016~5:24 PM~17~10~1~james e mooradian~ But otherwise it was pretty great
10/17/2016~5:24 PM~17~10~1~Aru B~ awe

10/17/2016~5:27 PM~17~10~1~james e mooradian~ More and more I'm thinking this daydream is just from some men's fashion ad

10/18/2016~10:08 PM~22~10~2~Aru B~ The door is right there, you can leave at any time you want. I'll stop talking about it and how I'm feeling, but if you can't just be there for me because this is really upsetting me then I really don't know where that leaves us.
10/18/2016~10:13 PM~22~10~2~james e mooradian~ No babe, there's a difference between talking to me and telling me how you're feeling and being a complete dick because you're feeling bad. What you're doing is hurting me and I wish you understood how you make me feel when you get so pissed off at everything when something like this happens
10/18/2016~10:14 PM~22~10~2~james e mooradian~ I always want to hear how you're feeling and I'm always gonna want to help, but you have to take me into consideration too
10/18/2016~10:15 PM~22~10~2~james e mooradian~ Don't not ever tell me anything because you think it makes me feel bad. Just maybe consider how the way you handle bad situations is making people around you feel
10/18/2016~10:16 PM~22~10~2~james e mooradian~ I still love you and I still wanna come down, but I also want you to treat me with respect
10/18/2016~10:22 PM~22~10~2~Aru B~ I'm sorry that I'm making you feel like that, but I don't think you're fully understanding how badly I'm coping. I know to you this is just a haircut I have and you think I'm just being a big baby about it but it really sucks when this is the lowest I've felt since I can remember and you don't want to hear it. I'm sorry I don't have the mental capacity to think of you and take your feelings into account. If my handling this is bad and I need to step back and consider others, I don't really think I have the ability to do that right now.
10/20/2016~3:00 PM~15~10~4~Aru B~ yo.

10/21/2016~10:41 AM~10~10~5~james e mooradian~ I probably put way more effort into this thing than she's thinking
10/21/2016~10:41 AM~10~10~5~Aru B~ i dont think its super formal, just a small write up. idk if that makes it easier on u or not
10/21/2016~10:41 AM~10~10~5~james e mooradian~ Lol it looks like a report atm
10/21/2016~10:41 AM~10~10~5~Aru B~ i think it was just a few paragraphs lol

10/21/2016~10:42 AM~10~10~5~james e mooradian~ So I started by listing my stats courses but I realized they are not at all self explanatory
10/21/2016~10:42 AM~10~10~5~james e mooradian~ So I wrote descriptions of them
10/21/2016~10:42 AM~10~10~5~james e mooradian~ Then I wrote some stuff I did at work but that needs some explanation
10/21/2016~10:42 AM~10~10~5~Aru B~ oh
10/21/2016~10:42 AM~10~10~5~Aru B~ i see what u did
10/21/2016~10:42 AM~10~10~5~james e mooradian~ So then I was putting down databases I worked on and I figured, fuck it lets go with the theme
10/21/2016~10:42 AM~10~10~5~Aru B~ aww
10/21/2016~10:43 AM~10~10~5~Aru B~ im proud of you but im finding this slightly hilarious.
10/21/2016~10:43 AM~10~10~5~james e mooradian~ And so I have a short paragraph of explanation for everything including my experience with coding langua
10/21/2016~10:43 AM~10~10~5~james e mooradian~ I had it in informal bullet form for a bit but I figure that I should at least show beata upfront that I'm a gd professional
10/21/2016~10:44 AM~10~10~5~Aru B~ lololol
10/21/2016~10:44 AM~10~10~5~Aru B~ baby

11/21/2016~8:45 AM~8~11~1~james e mooradian~ Yeah that was a theory I didn't believe
11/21/2016~8:45 AM~8~11~1~james e mooradian~ Really makes you wonder how many of those employees are hosts
11/21/2016~8:45 AM~8~11~1~james e mooradian~ Or like
11/21/2016~8:45 AM~8~11~1~james e mooradian~ Wtf is going on outside in the world
11/21/2016~8:46 AM~8~11~1~Aru B~ lol yeah
11/21/2016~8:50 AM~8~11~1~Aru B~ I'm on my way to werk now. I'm still so confused about what to do for thanksgiving. Francis was saying he might not stay till Friday and go back to the city on Thursday night bc Yvonne might not be able to take work off.
11/21/2016~8:51 AM~8~11~1~james e mooradian~ I guess that would mean the three of us would leave around the same time on Thursday
11/21/2016~8:52 AM~8~11~1~james e mooradian~ Have you talked more with your mom? I know it was kind of in a weird place on Saturday
11/21/2016~8:52 AM~8~11~1~Aru B~ Not really
11/21/2016~8:53 AM~8~11~1~Aru B~ I mean she went food shopping so I was helping her there bc I'm not a monster
11/21/2016~8:53 AM~8~11~1~james e mooradian~ Lol of course
11/21/2016~8:53 AM~8~11~1~Aru B~ But I still feel really weird about the whole thing
11/21/2016~8:53 AM~8~11~1~james e mooradian~ Sometimes you gotta step away from a conversation like that for a day
11/21/2016~8:53 AM~8~11~1~james e mooradian~ I do too hun
11/21/2016~8:54 AM~8~11~1~james e mooradian~ I'm on board with you either way
11/21/2016~8:55 AM~8~11~1~Aru B~ I told beata and she was like if I were her daughter she would be giving me the same advice
11/21/2016~8:55 AM~8~11~1~Aru B~ But she agrees that my mom is going about it and the wrong way
11/21/2016~9:03 AM~9~11~1~Aru B~ Idunno
11/21/2016~9:05 AM~9~11~1~Aru B~ :/
11/21/2016~9:05 AM~9~11~1~james e mooradian~ I guess I forget that your parents don't know me at all
11/21/2016~9:07 AM~9~11~1~james e mooradian~ They knew about me for like 3 years and maybe in their minds we should have either gotten engaged by now or broken up
11/21/2016~9:07 AM~9~11~1~james e mooradian~ I don't know
11/21/2016~9:07 AM~9~11~1~Aru B~ Perhaps
11/21/2016~9:08 AM~9~11~1~Aru B~ I don't get what it is. But it's really
upsetting~~~~~~
11/21/2016~9:08 AM~9~11~1~james e mooradian~ I agree
11/21/2016~9:08 AM~9~11~1~Aru B~ Are you ok? How are you doing
11/21/2016~9:08 AM~9~11~1~Aru B~ I can't imagine this is easy for you
11/21/2016~9:09 AM~9~11~1~james e mooradian~ Still stressed n tired but I'm trying to just kind of take it in stride I guess
11/21/2016~9:09 AM~9~11~1~Aru B~ :(
11/21/2016~9:10 AM~9~11~1~james e mooradian~ If we're doing this I'll go and get some flowers from the local florist and a bottle of whiskey for your dads
11/21/2016~9:10 AM~9~11~1~james e mooradian~ I don't know what else to do lol
11/21/2016~9:10 AM~9~11~1~Aru B~ :/

11/21/2016~9:13 AM~9~11~1~Aru B~ Do u think this is too much pressure and we should try to do a dinner or weekend with them some other time?
11/21/2016~9:15 AM~9~11~1~james e mooradian~ It's a lot of pressure, yeah. I feel like we need to do something soon if not now though
11/21/2016~9:16 AM~9~11~1~james e mooradian~ If I can prove that my presence doesn't disrupt Thanksgiving I think it'll go a long way
11/21/2016~9:16 AM~9~11~1~james e mooradian~ But I really don't know
11/21/2016~9:16 AM~9~11~1~Aru B~ No I agree with you
11/21/2016~9:16 AM~9~11~1~Aru B~ But idk how or when or what the timing should look like. :/
11/21/2016~9:16 AM~9~11~1~Aru B~ Also since I have a three day weekend and you have a three day weekend no matter what we do let's spend it together
11/21/2016~9:17 AM~9~11~1~james e mooradian~ Okies

11/21/2016~9:36 AM~9~11~1~james e mooradian~ Have you read 90+ page reports written by engineers? Not exactly the most engaging material
11/21/2016~9:36 AM~9~11~1~Aru B~ Sounds like a real page turner
11/21/2016~9:36 AM~9~11~1~Aru B~ It should be made into a major motion picture
11/21/2016~9:36 AM~9~11~1~Aru B~ Starting tom hanks
11/21/2016~9:36 AM~9~11~1~Aru B~ And Alec Baldwin
11/21/2016~9:36 AM~9~11~1~james e mooradian~ Perhaps if it was narrated by Morgan Freeman
11/21/2016~9:37 AM~9~11~1~Aru B~ Isn't he dating his granddaughter
11/21/2016~9:37 AM~9~11~1~Aru B~ Or niece or some shit

11/21/2016~9:40 AM~9~11~1~james e mooradian~ Man, it really feels like there are so few good people at that level of fame
11/21/2016~9:41 AM~9~11~1~james e mooradian~ I'm sure it's not true but it's so hard to tell nowadays
11/21/2016~9:42 AM~9~11~1~Aru B~ Yeah

11/21/2016~2:32 PM~14~11~1~james e mooradian~ Seems legit
11/21/2016~2:32 PM~14~11~1~Aru B~ but looks like there was some shit going on within the engineering team, and christina didnt agree w/ some decisions
11/21/2016~2:32 PM~14~11~1~Aru B~ and they tried working thru it and couldn't really
11/21/2016~2:32 PM~14~11~1~Aru B~ so she was asked to resign
11/21/2016~2:34 PM~14~11~1~Aru B~ but im happy that when i ask ppl just actually tell me

11/21/2016~4:00 PM~16~11~1~Aru B~ She starts with being like oh I'm sorry I upset u and I was able to articulate what exactly upset me
11/21/2016~4:00 PM~16~11~1~Aru B~ Then I said something else and she jumped back and was like OMG NO WHY
11/21/2016~4:00 PM~16~11~1~Aru B~ Then I had to clarify that she was taking what I meant wrong
11/21/2016~4:00 PM~16~11~1~Aru B~ And now she's just calmer but also a bit upset I think
11/21/2016~4:02 PM~16~11~1~james e mooradian~ That's... I don't even know

12/9/2016~12:10 PM~12~12~5~james e mooradian~ Usually between 20 and 30, yeah
12/9/2016~12:10 PM~12~12~5~Aru B~ thats a lot lol but i guess if u get delivery it makes sense
12/9/2016~12:11 PM~12~12~5~Aru B~ oof. yeah
12/9/2016~12:11 PM~12~12~5~james e mooradian~ Even if I make food it tends to get close to that
12/9/2016~12:11 PM~12~12~5~james e mooradian~ Mostly because I buy fresh from the co op and end up not eating all the food I make
12/9/2016~12:11 PM~12~12~5~Aru B~ oh yeh
12/9/2016~12:12 PM~12~12~5~Aru B~ does instacart deliver to u?

12/9/2016~12:12 PM~12~12~5~james e mooradian~ I wonder if there's any other way to get stuff from Costco
12/9/2016~12:13 PM~12~12~5~Aru B~ hit up dave
12/9/2016~12:13 PM~12~12~5~Aru B~ if u get a gift card
12/9/2016~12:13 PM~12~12~5~Aru B~ u dont have to pay the monthly fee i believe
12/9/2016~12:13 PM~12~12~5~james e mooradian~ That's what I've heard
12/9/2016~12:14 PM~12~12~5~Aru B~ https://20somethingfinance.com/shop-costco-without-membership/
12/9/2016~12:15 PM~12~12~5~Aru B~ http://www.costco.com/costco-memberships.html
12/9/2016~12:16 PM~12~12~5~Aru B~ you can get the cash card
12/9/2016~12:16 PM~12~12~5~Aru B~ which is the gift card.
12/9/2016~12:16 PM~12~12~5~Aru B~ the yearly fee is only 55$ for the most basic membership.
12/9/2016~12:22 PM~12~12~5~james e mooradian~ That's not terrible
12/9/2016~12:22 PM~12~12~5~Aru B~ the pricier one is a hundo
12/9/2016~12:22 PM~12~12~5~james e mooradian~ I'm not sure it would save me money in the long run though. I kinda want to see if it works out for me first
12/9/2016~12:22 PM~12~12~5~Aru B~ yeah, which is why the idea of the gift card is good.
12/9/2016~12:23 PM~12~12~5~Aru B~ with two ppl we def save money using it
12/9/2016~12:23 PM~12~12~5~Aru B~ and u eat twice as much as i do
12/9/2016~12:23 PM~12~12~5~Aru B~ so maybe u will too.
12/9/2016~12:23 PM~12~12~5~Aru B~ but them meatballs bro

12/9/2016~12:26 PM~12~12~5~james e mooradian~ I've never had costco pizza
12/9/2016~12:26 PM~12~12~5~Aru B~ but they add a small surcharge
12/9/2016~12:27 PM~12~12~5~james e mooradian~ Oh interesting
12/9/2016~12:28 PM~12~12~5~Aru B~ so just for basics it might make sense to do that too. but i'd def chat dave first
12/9/2016~12:28 PM~12~12~5~Aru B~ and he can help you out
12/9/2016~12:29 PM~12~12~5~james e mooradian~ Yeah he might be able to
12/9/2016~12:29 PM~12~12~5~james e mooradian~ He's usually in Somerville on the weekends nowadays but maybe he is here

12/12/2016~11:21 PM~23~12~1~james e mooradian~ If it saves her money that's a plus

12/24/2016~12:27 PM~12~12~6~james e mooradian~ So my stepdad is adamant about the fact that "Bill Nye is not a science Guy"
12/24/2016~12:27 PM~12~12~6~james e mooradian~ Sometimes I forget how much Fox news he watches
12/24/2016~12:33 PM~12~12~6~Aru B~ Lolol

12/24/2016~1:01 PM~13~12~6~Aru B~ Does he not believe in climate change too?
12/24/2016~1:09 PM~13~12~6~james e mooradian~ Based on my conversation with him it seems evident that's the case
12/24/2016~1:10 PM~13~12~6~james e mooradian~ The most public interaction Bill Nye has had with the Fox news spectrum was that huge publicized climate change debate he had against that crazy guy
12/25/2016~9:50 AM~9~12~7~james e mooradian~ Hey boopers merry christmas

12/25/2016~10:19 AM~10~12~7~Aru B~ Vaidus being moody today
12/25/2016~10:19 AM~10~12~7~Aru B~ She's visibly upset bc my mom was asking her about her Harvard application
12/25/2016~10:19 AM~10~12~7~Aru B~ And she just lost it
12/25/2016~10:19 AM~10~12~7~Aru B~ So now she's just moping around not doing anything
12/25/2016~10:20 AM~10~12~7~Aru B~ And she's just on her phone
12/25/2016~10:23 AM~10~12~7~Aru B~ She's gonna just complain about this entire trip
12/25/2016~10:23 AM~10~12~7~Aru B~ And be sure mopey
12/25/2016~10:23 AM~10~12~7~Aru B~ And I'm not enjoying it either but damn way to bring everyone down with you
12/25/2016~10:24 AM~10~12~7~Aru B~ She hasn't said one positive thing today
12/25/2016~10:24 AM~10~12~7~Aru B~ And keeps sniffling and looking like she's on the edge of
Tears~~~~~~
12/25/2016~10:24 AM~10~12~7~Aru B~ It's so frustrating omg
12/25/2016~10:39 AM~10~12~7~james e mooradian~ ðŸ˜• yeah jeez
12/25/2016~10:40 AM~10~12~7~james e mooradian~ Maybe if you can get her to open up and acknowledge things she'll be less mopey?
12/25/2016~10:41 AM~10~12~7~james e mooradian~ It must be really frustrating because it's a big part of her life plan and it could be her acknowledging her shortcomings in a way
12/25/2016~10:41 AM~10~12~7~james e mooradian~ Still though, if she's taking it out on everyone around her it isn't fair
12/25/2016~10:42 AM~10~12~7~james e mooradian~ Like I'm 600 miles away from her and I feel like she's been combative towards me with what little interaction we've had
12/25/2016~10:42 AM~10~12~7~james e mooradian~ I do not envy your position
12/25/2016~10:49 AM~10~12~7~james e mooradian~ I do remember how frustrating it was when I thought I had failed my stats exit exam the second time. I just remember you were really supportive and helped me keep a positive outlook on things. I think it could help her if you say to her what you said to me
12/25/2016~10:50 AM~10~12~7~james e mooradian~ You could also maybe cheer her up if you definitely are going to try for the GMAT and commit to being her study partner
12/25/2016~11:22 AM~11~12~7~Aru B~ Sigh
12/25/2016~11:22 AM~11~12~7~Aru B~ I can't wait for her to get in somewheee
12/25/2016~11:22 AM~11~12~7~Aru B~ Or get a job
12/25/2016~11:23 AM~11~12~7~james e mooradian~ I hear you

12/25/2016~11:27 AM~11~12~7~james e mooradian~ The thought of spending 3 weeks with my mom and dad would make me pee myself a little
12/25/2016~11:28 AM~11~12~7~james e mooradian~ Incidentally do you know what you're gonna be doing?

12/25/2016~11:49 AM~11~12~7~Aru B~ Bc she feels guilty eating alone
