 Haha nice
 So many commercials on tv for website building and marketing services. But the real question is can their CEO freestyle in a Scottish accent?
 Hahaha
 They sure can't
 That'll be the deal breaker question in rfp's for web designers. 'Oh you can't spit bars over this beat...gtfo.'
 Spent what seemed like hours going through sas files and taking notes..... Then I woke up. Worst type of dream.
 Life is bullshit man
 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ogXONbN_2To
 And then the case I helped carefully assemble...A group of auditors just ran a three p train on it.
 Gettin three-p'ed any god damn way
 But did they flip the dick down?
" Their team was methodical. Though they gave weak responses to some counters, they were in the position of power and they def flipped the dick down. Wouldn't have been surprise if I heard a bunch of hype men in the background of the conference call."
 Made me remember... In life you're either getting fucked in the ass or fucking people in the ass. Choose a position..... I might make my next job with the government regulators
 3Ps are seriously the way to go if you want a cushy ass job. Basically the authority/benefit of a government job with the pay of a private consultant
" Sometimes you have to work hard, but when you do, it's usually to shut down the studio"
 Yeah rolling up in places and screaming 'prepare to be fucked by the long dick of the law.' I need to get in on this consultant/regulatory train.
" Hahaha heavy booyah referencing today, awesome"
 So for labor day what foods should we bring? I still got that turkey in deep freeze and can always murk Meatman for more variety.
 Sea dogs anyone?
 Better get a keg of that raspberry beer to add to the bar
 Pretty sure showing up with a keg of sea dog would earn me a permanent ban from Alex's place. Though it would beg the question who would ever drink that much sea dog to warrant retailing of bulk quantities.
 Wait. Probably the girls impressed with my purchase of the sampler.
 Haha I remember that
" Haha I just talked with my mom and she said she can get stuff to grill for dinner and she has a ton of eggs from the neighbors. Other than that if you guys wanted to bring stuff for lunch like cold cuts, bread, etc. and other stuff to go with eggs for breakfast like bagels and whatnot, that would be cool. Also some snacks and and a water bottle or two for hiking could be good."
 Yeah a hiking snack besides almonds would be good. Would the turkey be doable?
" If you're going to bring it, you should probably start thawing it in the fridge. It'd be doable if thawed"
 Yep I'll start that tonight. Or me and Jim can do fast faucet thingamajig defrost like our previous turkey cooking adventures.
" Haha probably better to just start thawing tonight, faucet defrost was less than optimal"
 I'll get some fancy Italian cold cuts.  Get some prosciutto up in this bitch
 Sopressata is the way to go dude. Trust
 Also do we have methods for cooking turkey?
" Yeah, I just asked my mom if it would be possible and she said definitely"
 Aw sheeeit... We're gonna get so weird.
 <Media omitted>
 Haha
 Gonna go 'ape shit'
 Better start looking up good ways to cook this bad boy
 I'm thinking combo overnight brine and butter/herbs under the skin
 Awww Jim you nasty
 That picture lol. Had to mute the phone to laugh during a doctor call.
 Hey Dave do you think the turkey is still good to eat? Not sure what a year of freezer storage does to meats
 <Media omitted>
 Google says it should be ok
 Lol it might be on the cusp
 Should be I've checked and its did for 9 months to a year
 Hey we could always pull a bear grylls on a hike
 Oh Jesus haha
 Lol just lie back and think of England
 'So sorry... Oh argh uh... So sorry'
 Lmao
 Well I've had food poisoning 3 times now so I'm practically an expert.  I'll help us all through it if that should befall is

 <Media omitted>
 Felt like it was again germane to the convo
 I'll bring some backup meat just in case the turkey turns into Shaq attacks on the backboard.
 When exactly did you get that turkey?
 November....
 Was it fresh when you got it or was it frozen?
 Frozen always
 We should be ok then
 I mean the turkey may have been frozen for a while before then right?
 How long does frozen food hang around at costco
 Eh its probably fine
 10-11 months frozen

 Here's some other ones near okemo

" Haha just noticed that in the last link, the hike that we did last time is listed as 'aggressive'"
" This one goes by some sweet cliffs, about 2.5h round trip "
""
 About a half hour drive from ludlow
 2.5 hour round trip sounds good. Not 3 hours one way.
 Haha nice
 Yeah 2.5 hours is solid
" Haha yeah, full disclosure, it does involve doing over 1000 vertical ft. I figure though that if it gets strenuous, it won't be like we're in a rush, so we could take our time, have snacks and rests and stuff"
 1000 ft is nothing
" The hikes I did out west were about 2500ft, 3-4 hrs"
 Yeah we're gonna clown all over this trail
 This will be nice for my hiking resume.
 We'll take some photos so you can pimp out your Okc profile

 How are we all getting up to Vermont? Any carpooling or pick ups from the bus station?
 I'm bringing Rob.  Planning to drive up in his car
 I'm planning on heading up in the early afternoon around 2 or 3 from Storrs
 I have work until 6 tomorrow. Might lug the turkey to work and and stash it in the fridge.
 Then make a straight shot up 91 for an ETA of 2100
 Jim dunno if you wanna carpool?
 I can carpool. I'll probably have to work until between 6 and 7 tmmr
 Depending on where you work tmmr we can either carpool from new Haven or meet somewhere on the way
 I'll be in Wallingford so a quick hop on 15
 Works for me
 I'll drive down to New Haven. Should get there just about the same time you get out of work.
 Nice dude. Gonna get so schwifty this weekend.
 Gotta shit on the floor
 lol what
" Rick and Morty, dude. Watch it. It'll change your life."
 Oh yeah been meaning to watch that
" Just thought of another thing for VT. If you guys could bring sleeping bags and pillows, that would help minimize the number of sheets to wash at the end of the weekend."
 Ok
 So on top of the turkey I'm bringing some back ribs. Anyone gonna handle the vegetable department. Really want nothing but net all weekend.
 Do you want me to handle some of the meat department? I can go to the elm city market and get some fresh to death butchered cuts tomorrow afternoon
 Figured a whole family sized turkey would be a ton of food tho
 <Media omitted>
 Aw nice
" I can always get some cuts, just keep it in mind"
 T boner steak?
 Yeah I'd be down for some boners too.
 Yes please
 I'll see what they got
 Porterhouse is a tough cut to cook but it's fucking tasty
 That'd be sweet
" You sure that won't be too much? We're only there for two dinners. My mom already made meatballs, sausage and peppers and she picked up steak tips. She'll likely have a batch of chili too she said."
 Sounds like we're gonna achieve a Kenny Powers level of awesomeness
 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mZE9fJ-ER0M
 And bring your homebrew empties
 I recycled mine 😕
 Didn't realize we were supposed to keep them
 I still got mine. I'll bring them up
" Butze, this is why we can't have nice things... Jk, I'll just pick up extra bottles for the next bottle session."
 Sry dude
 <Media omitted>
 Nice
 Looks like the end of this weekend will be like trying to duck a beach ball through a basketball hoop.
 Dunk*
 Better bring the snake
" If anyone is still gonna be stopping at a store, I need fresh basil.  They're all out at whole foods.  If not no big deal"
 Nvm I found it
 Do I need to pick anything up? Feels kinda weird bring more or less empty handed
 Tons of stuff here
 I can pick up more vegetables than the lone pepper I had in the picture
" No worries, we're pretty stocked up here. Could always bring some beer. Found out that the taps have been shut down while my dad's away. We still have a good amount of beer though here"
 Noooo :(
" Yeah, apparently he was having some problems with one of the controllers and didn't have time to get it all straightened out"
 Oh damn 😨
 Okay I can pick up some beet
 Beer
" We just left, should get there at 1030-11"
 Sounds good
 Dave and I are on our way top
 We'll probably get there a little after 11

 And yeah klunge. That British vernacular.
 Remember that article one of yall posted a while back about when and when not to 'give a fuck' and learning to ration out your fuck-giving? Where was that from? Anyone still have the link?
" Lol I don't remember that article, but it sounds interesting"
" And I scrolled past pencil mustache pizza man, I could hear the words 'it'sa tight butthole'"
 As i*
 Here's the article: http://markmanson.net/not-giving-a-fuck
 YES
 thank you
" Speaking of not giving a fuck, I've decided to go full retard with growing a beard."
 👍
 Hell yeah
 You won't regret it
 http://giphy.com/gifs/104ueR8J1OPM2s

 He's saying 'do it' if you weren't able to tell
 That YouTube video was great gif fodder
 Ah. Was about to say being cool like shia labeouf is not making a good case for having a beard.
 That's one of the more tame gifs of him saying 'do it'
 <Media omitted>
 Awesome
 So here's a little anecdote I think yall will appreciate.  I recently found out via Facebook that a kid I used to go to prep school with went to divinity school and recently became ordained as a deacon in the episcopal church.  I recalled a particular conversation I had with him in 7th grade about our mutual interest in pornography.  He confided in me that he especially enjoyed videos of anal porn because he 'loves the sound the girl makes when it goes in'.  Yeah.  Now the dude is serving people communion on Sundays.
 Jesus
 Yup
 I'm not sure what's worse: the fact that he's ordained clergy now or the discussion you two had as seventh graders.
 Lol.  It actually might have been 8th grade.  Not that that really makes it any better
 The sound of butt stuff is also stuck in my head.
 But yeah even I was a bit taken aback at the time
 Being all of 14 years old
" Those were the early days of the internet, too. Don't think any streaming sites existed yet. Or if they did it was pixel porn. He'd have that stuff on hard copy DVD/vhs."
 Yeah.  Or limewire
" Yeah way before HD, way before 16:9 standard. Those clicky clack days of porn."
 'Back in my day we had to work for our porn!'

" Damn, I had conversation with my mom about my time at UConn. And I remembered how much I fucking hated that place.

Or crossing streets with no fucks given while staring down bro drivers and occasionally whispering 'do it ya mother fucker.'"

 <Media omitted>
 I'm LOLing just imagining you standing in a crosswalk saying 'do it motherfucker'
 That's also why I find it particularly funny when Rick throws out the taunt in near death situations.

" People always repeat the 'college is the best time of your life' or 'I'd doing anything to relive college' mantras. I say bull shit.  I'm much happier in the workforce. Sure, I met great people and had some important life lessons. But overall college is a really disturbing 4 (7 in my case) year carnival/microcosm that I don't need to experience again. Had my fill."
 Now I'm thinking... if I'm ever a parent how'd I justify sending a barely mature adult to such a place and paying 30-60k per year.
 Yeah I think everyone has a different 'best time' of their life.  For some unfortunate people it was high school... Wouldn't want to be one of them.
 The goal should be to 'peak' as late as possible.  Or never.  Just keep getting more awesome
" When I'm 90, I'm gonna be going 90"

" Also, I wish there was a one of the phone 'helpers' like siri or cortana but with the Mr. Meeseeks voice."
 Oh man yeah that comic. So good but yeah pretty gloomy
 Yeah most of it is kind of gloomy but the end really ties it together on a brighter note.
 When Micky realizes he is #blessed to have his buddies
" 'It's just crazy cause I was just thinking, I don't have any friends who I've known my whole life. You guys all watched each other the whole way...you've all come so far. You're all doing new and exciting stuff and leading these crazy lives and you've still got so much to do. I wish I had a friend like that. Who was with me for like, the whole journey.'"
 Fuckin gets me right in the feels every time
 <Media omitted>
 Just realized that that comic is multiple pages! I'll have to check out the rest. Seems pretty heavy tho. Reminds me of that time Mike Mitchell watched the movie Click by Sandler et al. and was moved to subsequently tell everyone that he appreciated them. I think he even called his mom.
 LOL wow
 But yeah you gotta read the whole thing.  It's a masterpiece
" Changing subjects, I just gotta vent real quick about some TA bullshit. Yesterday, the professor that I TA for tried unknowingly (because her math is weak sauce) to assign me a grading load the violated my contract hours. I made an excel sheet and did basic hours accounting to prove to her that she had indeed violated it. Totally QED'd her. But now she's acting like she can still negotiate with me. I'm supposed to show my calculations to the other TAs tomorrow to make sure they agree, which as I see it doesn't matter. If they don't, I'm gonna straight go to the department head and if that doesn't work to the union if I have to. I don't get what the fuck she don't understand about contracts. Fucking academics sometimes, man... Sheeeuuuttt"
 Lol I did not get the impression that click was that kind of movie
 Also that is some bullshit
 Seems common as fuck but its still not fair
 I think UConn is one of those schools where the professors are hired with the idea that they devote 95% of their time to research
 Lol damn dude. Props for fighting back tho
 Just gotta stonewall her.  What's yours is yours
 Hahaha
 I agree with sean
 Gotta keep it real
 Show them what happens when you find a stranger in the alps
 Is Alex Cocco gonna have to choke a bitch?
" That exactly what I'm doing. Haha I'm not budging an inch. Told her today that as she has it now, either she is violating my contract or the students' papers that I grade get roughly half (turns out that the actual fraction cus I did the fuckin math) the attention that those of their peers get. Up to her"
 QED Bitch
 Does your department ever use undergad graders? We do it all the time at tufts to reduce the load on the grad TAs.  And the labor is cheaper
 I know that's happened in the past with the CE department. I'm not sure how common it is with other departments though
" Ah, classic delegating... Keeps the world a turning."
" On a side note, my mom told me I really needed to shave this morning. Asked me how I'm supposed to find a girl while rocking facial scruff....."
 'Mom that's what the bitches like these days'
 For some reason I'm hearing that delivered in the tone and voice of the apple jacks kids.
 Hahaha
 We eat what we like
 Hahaha fits well
" Speaking of beards... I was out on a date last night at a bar.  Some random guy walks up to me and says 'I'm sorry man but I just have to do this real quick' and starts stroking my beard for a couple seconds, then walks away.  Few minutes later his friend comes up and explains that he bet the other guy that he wouldn't try to touch my beard.  I chuckled heartily.  He bought me a beer because he lost the bet."
 Really getting some serious ROI out of this thing
 Can't wait for the returns on the beard I'm growing. Especially since I'll be Asian with a beard. That's like a Articuno status.
 LOL nice Pokemon reference

 Number one most hated phrase in textbooks: 'we leave this as an exercise for the reader'

They're GIANTS, man, picking you up is like lifting a couple of grapes for them'"

 One of my friends at tufts tried to use that exact line as part of his write up of a problem for a homework assignment.  The TA was not impressed.

 At least for now until you take Dave off the grid

 Btw Sean if you're getting a suv with a different personal brand. You could look into the Toyota FJ. The car screams 'I am outdoor adventure bro.' Combo that with a pair of Oakley's and you'll probably give of the impression that you crush light beer on the reg.
 Lol it looks like the retarded child of a hummer and a tonka truck
 Yeah the vehicle caters to a special group of people. Like if you want give of an obnoxious poo brain vibe.

" Yeah, congratulations, Sean!"

" Nice, just got told by a member to go have a stroke. Should have responded with no I'm probably gonna meet my demise in some carpet related accident."
 Lol what
 A member of what?
 Member of one of the pharmacy benefit plans
 Kinda had to lay down some bad news on the member
 Yikes
 Making grandma eat alpo?
 Had to deny a needa need for a stroke patient. But the wasn't related to testing the stroke itself. More like the patient had some nerve issues post stroke. The need could possible be used for those nerve problems but in accordance to gov regs there's not enough support. So I had to deny.
 Poor grandma
" Insurance is not making people eat alpo, but more like preventing people from frivolously using meds (especially expensive shit) and making everyone else attached to the plan eat alpo."
 Yeesh

 Had a discussion about how the office would go about letting someone go and the upcoming security preparations. Assessing the risk that said employee would go postal.

 Trucknutz
 Brilliant
 What about mud flaps with that girl silhouette
 'She looked like the girl on the mud flaps' -Jimmy
 Need a 'no farms no food' bumper sticker. Whatever the hell that's even supposed to mean
 Lol classic
" If you go trucknutz and mudflaps, you'd definitely need the Monster energy sticker. Maybe toss in the fox racing for good measure. But that's a whole different set of girls. Like girls that shot guns and maybe went to community college."
 Ah painting with broad strokes

 Oh cool

 Lol nope guess not
 And that's the way the news goes
" Haha, looks like the entirety of 'the weird' went. That's cool though, would you really want to go to a wedding? They've never been my favorite, and less so the less I know the people"
 Lol I mean I've been to a few weddings for people our age. They can be really fun depending on who's getting married
 That being said I don't know how much fun a wedding would be with the entirety of 'the weird' as the wedding party
 Lol the weird
 They'd probably be calling you 'sprinkles.'
 Wootzy and Boo
 Oh yeah... That
 Then again that whole perspective thing... Maybe they referred to us as the weird too.
 Remember we were so cool back in those days.
 Yeah true... But... Let's not forget the penis party

" So today I dropped a real triumphant one in my toilet and clogged it real bad.  Plunged it 6 or 7 times, no dice.  Ended up driving to Home Depot to buy a snake. Then came home and had to watch some tutorials on YouTube to learn how to operate it.  Then I had to snake my own toilet, and dislodged a massive turd from deep within.  It was not a pleasant experience. But somewhat proud I finally dropped a David Wu caliber deuce."

 Aru thinks its too angular

 Haha thanks
 Yeah the squared edges are somewhat divisive but I like it. I get a lot of compliments  which is cool
 It's tough when it gets to that length for sure
 You gotta contend with it puffing out too much on the sides
 Yeah I keep the sides tight.  That's the key

 Lol yeah its always an option
 Hookers on a private jet

 I mean aside from the late 90s era hedonism
 Haha yeah
 Eh I guess you never know. There's always those tech bootcamps if I gotta make something work
 Wouldn't mind checking out the Seattle area if it came to that tbh
 Seems pretty relevant
 Yeah there's a lot of those around.  Surprised there's not more demand for your stats skillz though.  Thought people were fiending for data people
 For every 20 or so cool sounding openings on the west coast there's like one in NYC
 Most are looking for senior data scientists far as I can tell
 Like a finance firm trying to retrofit the past 15 years of tech research
 Hmm interesting
 Looking more and more at business days analyst and quant style positions

" So today I had to google a letter format for some loan documents. Ended up finding info on a credit score forum. Normally, I see posts with flair like lists of prior phones on a smartphone group, computer specs for gaming, car upgrades, or other hobby/rl achievement stuff. On the credit forum, people listed credit scores as flair. It was kinda surreal. Always thought credit scores was something you keep to yourself."
 Hahaha wow
 Niche forums are strange places
 I bet that's like a candy store for identity theives

 Yeah I'm actually kind of relieved.  Wasn't too psyched about the idea of living there and paying retarded rent for a shoebox apartment.  Still would have been nice to get an offer though.
 Man their hiring bar is like soooo fuckin high though.  I knew it was high but like god damn. The recruiter did me the courtesy of reading through all 4 of my interviewers' feedback detailing every mistake and shortcoming of my solutions.
 Like cool bro thanks
 Jesus. That's rough.
 Damn man. Sorry to hear that but yeah everything I hear about Google interviews is pretty similar. They've got a really high false negative rate though so you can always apply a little later

" Oh snap, is that from the local Vermont chainsaw bear carver dude?"
 Damn dude that's really gonna tie the house together
" It almost begs the question, how much more awesome can the house get? And the answer is none.  None more awesome."
" I dunno, if Alex's dad decides to start a brewery operation I'd have a hard time being disappointed in the turn of events"
 That house is like countable infinity
 True
 Hahaha
 The Limit Does Not Exist
" Haha If you look closely, you'll see that it's holding a beer mug. My dad had it carved by this guy in Chester. You know the house with the huge mailbox? That guy. He's also made a bunch of beats for Steven Tyler. The guy's name is, I shit you not, Barry. Barry the bear-carving guy. He does it with a chainsaw"

 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_RD6rigX0Eo
 Hahaha exactly
 That's pretty sweet
 Very impressive hand drafting skills too
 Does volume to surface area apply here? I'm pretty bad with theoretical maths
 In what way?
 I think the original proof was basically concerned with magnitudes of infinite sets.  Basically showing that the infinite quantity of all real numbers is equal to that of any subset. Which is crazy cool
 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleph_number
" Each line in the lower half corresponds to a half circle in the top half. The diameter of each circle corresponds to the interval from 0 to 1 on the circle's corresponding line. A line is drawn from each circle's midpoint to a point outside of the interval from 0 to 1. Where that line intersects the circle, a line is drawn from the intersection to the circles diameter such that that line and the diameter are perpendicular. That process, which maps a point outside of the interval to exactly one point inside the interval can be repeatedly for all of the infinite points on the real line outside of the interval. Therefore, the mapping is one to one and the infinity of points inside the interval is exactly equal to the infinity of points outside of the interval (in mathspeak, they have the same 'cardinality'). For each half circle, I've drawn 4 example mappings. Then I repeat the drawing using the previous drawing as the 0 to 1 interval is the next. That way the nesting of Infinities becomes more obvious."
 Makes for some pretty sweet album art too
 So cool. You're nerd level is like uncountably infinite.

" Haha, excellent use of 'majesty'"
 Have you guys seen the video of bill burr explaining how to bake a pie crust? Hilarious
 http://youtu.be/LoWCMzHWlRk
 Haha that's amazing.  He should have his own cooking show
" I was thinking the exact same thing, 'Go Fuck Yourself: Cooking with Billy Red Face'"
 I could watch him demonstrate just about anything
 I need bill burr to come in my office and demo stamps.com.
" For real, we keep running out of stamps and having to make runs to the post office."
 lol
 'Stamps.com everybody! Ya gonna love it.  No more waitin in line at the post office like a fuckin jackass'

 It's for this secret Santa ornament swap that we do on my mom's side of the family. So she's not even going to know who it's from as she opens it. Can't wait
 Haha nice
 Prescribed calls are always hilarious when I have nurse coming through the headset on one ear and DMX playing in the other ear.
 Especially when the nurse gives me wrong info and DMX punctuates with 'you think this is a game!!!'
 Woof woof!
 Check out this blurb for Bill Burr's interview with Jimmy Fallon

 Haha classic billy
 Lol. Great description.
 His rant is great too. Can't wait for his series to come to Netflix on Friday

" When I see Christmas lights strung up in the neighborhood, I don't think about Christmas hogwash. Rather, I remember the time we spelled Prudence with lights and we were the cool kids... Good times."
" I honestly was a huge fan of those Christmas lights. The blow up Santa's/frosty the snowmen, not so much"
" Hey man, now that you're an official homeowner, you can continue the tradition of gaudy Christmas decoration"
 Maybe give it a festive 'holiday booyah' theme
" Like one of those blinking motion light setups, where a nutsack made of lights goes in and out of a butthole"
 Maybe you can do one of those music synced l

 Lol. No Christmas lights for the place. It's an ugly rear unit building. Strictly clear heels updates.
 Hey this is Aru. When are you having your slumlord house party?!?! I volunteer jmmys place for the venue....

" Amazing, love when the lady was like 'we got the lyrics to Rudolph' and X was like 'bitch, please! I know the damn lyrics! *bark *bark'"
 Lol DMX.
 And I just noticed Aru's post. Hope she didn't read any other posts in the thread.
" Damn, just did my intro call to my tenant. The seriousness of this endeavor finally hit me. I feel like I should out on some real pants."
 Your adult game is so strong right now
 Damn man that's a pretty big 'successful adult' moment
 I'm pretty sure Aru is okay with our level of humor
" I don't know about this 'successful adult' thing. All the stress, coffee, and fast-food/office Christmas dessert meals; really been taking a toll on my field goal percentage. Been Shaq-ing the porcelain."

 Nice. Where's that rock?
 Brooklyn boulders. The gym near my place
 You guys see that new star wars movie yet?
" Just gotta say, it was super weird watching Sean's old profile pic as a sith lord"
 Darth Sneaky Butcher?
 But haven't seen it yet. Heard it was good. Though I'm afraid I'm gonna be thinking about cabbage patch doll lunchboxes when kylo ren appears.
 I'm seeing it tomorrow.  Didn't know that dude was in it
 Lol yeah I mean it's not a spoiler or anything but it was jarring as fuck when you see his face
 Just imagining him from girls
 Being creepy as ever
 Saw Star Wars today.  Yeah it was decent but Adam Driver as the villain definitely didn't work.  Maybe if I hadn't seen girls and watched him jizz on Lena Dunham
 Any film or show he appears in I just think cabbage patch whisperer.

 Yeah merry Christ. That emoji is def disturbing
 Wait what is going on in that card?
 There's someone else in the bed
 I thought it was one of those 'excited to get up on christ morning' kind of things
 I guess it's a Christmas B and E featuring animated Sean
 <Media omitted>
 That's amazing
 Hahaha just read this string of messages. That custom bitmoji is hilarious
 You guys should all make one.  It's fucking hilarious
" Was gonna say it seems a little basic, but then again I just made a Pinterest."

 So when you guys coming up to VT?
 <Media omitted>
 Hahaha awesome
 I'm boarding in Colorado for the next 4 days.  Flying back late on the 30th.  So I'm planning to drive up on the 31st with Rob
" I'll be coming up on the 31st as well. Although, Sean, do you want to carpool? I think I might be in Somerville to check on the house."
 Nice
 Yeah we can probably carpool
 Alex let me know what i can bring
" If all you guys could just bring a towel, pillow, and a sleeping bag. Most likely won't need the sleeping bag, but just in case."
 Ok
 What about food and drink
" Don't worry about food or drink, we're gonna have a ton of stuff"
 Aight
" The other day my cousin's kid got a new tablet and I was helping him set it up. The gmail stuff was easy, but then came the security part, Facebook, privacy and parental monitoring part. It then dawned on me just how woefully inept I'd be at raising a kid in the internet age. I have no idea how to keep a child safe from the horrors of the internet."
 <Media omitted>
 Haha
 Yeah it's pretty much impossible
 <Media omitted>
 Lol nice
 Classic James puttin in extra hours
 Lol its my first day back this week
 According to the schedule there will be less people here on Wed and Thurs
 Looks like someone can work with no pants.
 You coming to VT James?
" As much as I'm a fan of hanging with my dick out, I think I'll avoid that while I'm out of the house"
" No, not gonna be able to come this year"
 My gramma's funeral is the 2nd so I'm gonna avoid being too far from Stamford this year
 :(
 I'll be more than happy to make the trip up any other time you guys have free
 Sry bout your grandma bro
 Thanks man. We all sort of saw it coming a way off but it was tough on the family all the same
 Hope y'all have a good time up in VT though
 Gonna miss searching the house for Dave at 10pm
 We'll drink extra for you
 Maybe we'll get one of those kiddie leashes for Dave and tether him to the house LOL
 Hey man I never left the house I just needed a nap.
" Jim, sorry to hear about your grandma."
" Sorry to hear about your Grandma, Jim. We'll definitely have another trip up to VT in the new year. My parents also just recently bought a house on the beach in Madison, CT, so we'll all have to get together there one of these weekends"
 Thanks guys. And yeah any time you guys happen to be free would be cool with me. Madison is super close to where I live too

" What do you guys think of making a beer tasting app? It's basic function would be to let people join a 'tasting chat' like what we have here in WhatsApp, then the group would enter the names of beers as they try them and the group could rate each one as they drink. The app would tally the scores and keep track of everyone's tastes. There could even be a means of sharing 'playlists' of beer lineups for tastings. You could get other users to recommend good tasting lineups like 'great VT IPAs' for example. Or you could even get master Brewers to design playlists that highlight what they are trying to accomplish with their beers. There could also be a function that works like that community playlist app that Rob and Butze had at that party at Rob's house. Butze, would this be possible to program? We could get Rob involved too."
 Sounds like a good idea. Linking it up with brewers and package stores would be key. Make it an avenue for promotion.
 Sounds like a cool idea.  I'll talk to rob about it this week
" Cool, sounds good. Dave, thinking more along the promotions line, imagine if you could walk into any of those huge beerfests and the app would give you and your friends possible tasting routes through the festival to travel so that you could strategically go about your tasting experience. All the while you can rate the beers in realtime with your group."
" Alex, how did the fermentation bucket look. Any bubbling or warmth coming off the bucket? Maybe some bread smell."
 Wasn't any bubbling so my dad took a quick peak under the lid. he said that despite the lack of bubbles it looks like something is happening.
 Hmm. There might be some growth lag time before the yeast population explodes and they start putting up condos in the bucket.
 Unfortunately there's no thermometer on the bucket. A temperature rise would mean activity.
 We should have drilled another bunghole for checking temperature. A 'thermobung' haha
 The 'you gonna get DP'ed any goddamn way' clip just played in my head'

" Alex, how's the beer bucket looking?"
" Not sure, my parents have been in CT this week. Hopefully it's going well"
 Found a great intro book to mathematical logic for free online. Just google 'how to prove it pdf' and it'll come up
 Nice
" As I sit in traffic, I notice how absurd it is that each person lugs at least +3000 lb of empty car to and from work. There has to be a way to take advantage of all this wasted movement. Kinda like how red blood cells jostle around there circulatory network but act as carriers."
 I'd guess people's desire for independence/autonomy is greater than their dislike of traffic or cost of driving.  Probably won't change until overpopulation reaches a critical point or fuel costs become prohibitive
 Or if public transit becomes good enough so that people don't feel like they lose any autonomy by choosing it.
 <Media omitted>
 Lol
 So I made a noob scripting mistake this morning
 Wasn't paying attention to my code and accidentally made a looping recursive program that started up multiple copies of itself every loop
 I tried manually closing it before I realized what was going on

 But seriously I just roughed it on a tarp. Would not recommend.
 Jesus man you shoulda told me sooner I would have lent you the air mattress
 I take it as penance. I may be stuffing some poor students in the basement.
 Oh yeah?
 My realtor found me two business students looking for accommodations on the cheap.
" Alex, is the homebrew bucket healthy and fermenting?"
 Seems to be! My dad just started the secondary fermentation. Hopefully it comes out well. My uncle Pat's also for a batch going. He bought kettle and a fermenting tank after we did the Mutt's Nuts batch in VT
 Oooo weee everyone's brewing
" Yup, the two batches should be done around the same time too, so there's gonna be a lot of beer to drink"
 Oooo wee he's tryin!!
 I'm looking at the various versions of turbotax and all I can think of is the making the band. 'You just gonna do your taxes right now. Is that hot? Is that what's going down in the streets?'

 Decided to try it on that pic you guys sent for nye

 Lol
 Hahahaha
 Scrolling through the 'people you may know' page on LinkedIn and laughing at how virtually all of the d-bag types I knew from high school are all 'business analysts' and 'account executives'
 Isn't that like corporate entry level.
 Or at least in pharma/pharma advertising
 Yeah that's entry level biz
 I don't think they have a position called 'fresh from business school' so they slap the word analyst on it
 Fresh fruit cocktail for management
 It's really weird in the finance industry too because that's what every single entry level person is called
 Most of them don't do any analyses
 Makes me think of that HRO Carles article about buying clothes on entry level wage
 Lol effing jcrew
 Yeah this one dudes job title is literally just 'analyst'
 I think analyst is basically code word for 'I work at the business factory and make excel sheets all day'
 Haha
 It's just a title nowadays like associate or VP
 After ten years everyone is avp
 Account executive is corposeak for salesman
 Your highschool acquaintances can come home every day and tell their loved ones that they did a business
 A VP* not alien vs predator
 speak*
 Yeah
 Went to the stock market and did a business again today
 I've seen some tech companies use the title 'sales engineer' for sales people.  Like LOLwut
 Those kinda buzzwords just make things so much worse
 Just slap engineer on the end of your title and instantly make your job seem cool
 Janitorial Services Engineer
 Buttstuff engineer
 Urnial Cake Replacement Engineer
 urinal*
 Just like those company 'about' pages that all day 'we use data integration and next level insights to produce business intelligence growth across a variety of verticals'
 Hahaha yea
 All say*
 Last year a friend of mine came back from a career fair at school and was like 'Guys! You'll never believe it! All of the companies at the career fair today all do the same thing!'
 We were like 'oh yeah what?'
 'B2b enterprise cloud solutions for the new millennium distilling insights from big data in the cloud!'
 Oh god
 It was so funny
 And then we proceeded to look up random company websites and laugh at the About pages
 Because they really do all sound like that
 It's fucking horrendous actually applying for those jobs too
 They're all exactly the same
 I'm pretty sure I've applied for 30 or 40 places that all do data analytics SaaS that deliver BI insights
 And apparently all of them have yahoo and Microsoft as a client
 Haha yeah
 That's why you need to start Mooradian Tech.
 And fluff up the company description
 It's pretty frustrating.  Feels like close to half of all tech companies basically just make some kind of analytics platform
" I'm convinced that they do, honestly"
 Most of them seem like they're just more user friendly versions of SQL
" Here's the play: leverage the trend and build a software framework for building analytics business insight platforms.  Like just study all of the common features and package them up.  'Instant analytics company, just add water and buzzwords'"
 Hahah
" Like build a bear, but for genetic data companies"
 Generic*
 If it weren't for a lot of companies having just the worst data management possible that would be super easy to do
 But those SaaSes aren't for those people anywau
 Just get something colorful and blocky
 Like those donut peg games for toddlers but in app form
 Yeah
 I feel like you could just tell those people about weka
 Or just make weka look colorful and shit
 Hahaha yeah
 Not a bad idea.  Just build a pretty UI over weka.  Boom $100 million VC investment
 Colorful charts and numbers fuck you you'll buy it
 I think that's what some companies have already done with hadoop
 Combine weka with shiny
 I guess there's a need for it
 Yeah
 What's that funky smell in the basement. Dead mice. #traphouseproblems

" Haha awesome, just heard his radio show on Monday. He kept playing this band called Soft Moon. Even did 3 songs of theirs in a row"
 Nice
" Anyone know an efficient algorithm or ideally pre-written program for finding shortest paths between all pairs of nodes in a network where the links between nodes are weighted?  They have something like that for traffic, Jim?"
 I usually use a premade algo built into the software i use
 The greedy algorithm is pretty decent for a simple one
 But I'm told there's a better algorithm to be used that you can probably find in an algorithms textbook
 What's the software you use? Can it handle 1000's of nodes?
 Oh yeah
 CUBE voyager
 I use
" Nice, sweet name haha"
" Most of my networks are 5000 zones, maybe 60-100k nodes"
 Yeah lol
 TransCAD is similar
 If you have access to CUBE I can give you a bunch of scripts
 It's not super common outside of industry asaik
 AFAIK*
" Cool, i'll look into those and see what UConn has licenses for. Thanks."
 You need that Dijkstras algorithm brah
 I think Python has a pretty robust graph library that can probably do it for you in like 2 lines of code
" Yeah, I mostly worried about computation time. I will have relatively large spatial graphs and I want to couple the flow through multiple graphs, so I might need to solve them multiple times. Python's a good idea though. Probably has some parallel options"
 Yeah I mean python packages are hit and miss sometimes but I imagine a dijkstra package would work decently
 Cython integration helps too
 How is your network set up?
 Youd likely have to reestablish it somehow depending on the program you use
" I can represent it in any form I want. I have the fundamental data as ASCII files. Just found something called NetworkX for Python, which could be helpful"
 Might work decently for what you need. CUBE definitely does the job quickly (think probably 1-2 hour on a single core for 3000-5000 zones to load the path at equilibrium and maybe a minute or two to find a single iteration set of shortest paths) but you might not have access to it
 If you're not doing equilibrium network loading I wouldn't worry too much about computation time
 Unless the algo is poorly optimized i wouldn't imagine more than 10 minutes for single iteration on one core
 https://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/reference/algorithms.shortest_paths.html
" Cool, ok, I'm going to try some options out and see what I have access too. Thanks for the infos."

 I think just 2 more weeks until drinking

 I'm free the weekend of the 27-28th
 Unless I need to show a unit to renters
 I think that would work for me as well
 That one works for me too
" Sheeuuutt, I have to go to Long Island that weekend to do experiments. Would the weekend after work?"
 Not for me 😞
 I suppose I could sit this one out if we can't make something work.  Don't wanna deprive everyone of homemade beer
 We can always do it the week after that. It's not like it goes bad in a couple weeks
 Alright yeah I might be able to do the week after

 Job listing 'Benefits: Great benefit package'

 It's upsetting how poorly we treat workers in this country
 'Murica

 Yeah the Japanese are workaholics too.  But vast majority of developed nations are so much better.  It's embarrassing
 Yeah
" I mean I know Spain is doing pretty poorly at the moment, but it sounds pretty idyllic there based on things I hear from George and manuella"
" People working maybe 20-30 hours a week, having week-long holidays, and just generally chilling so hard"
 Yeah.  European culture is great.
 Well at least our work culture is still better than Asia.
 Just gotta marry a European chick.  Get that dual citizenship.  Ahbooyah
" Had to deny an infirmed priest's medication. The facility took a while to pull the guy out of bed and into a wheel chair just to receive my call. All the while i was left on hold with choir/Gregorian chant music. Unfortunately the priest was no longer coherent, so i hastily said my bit about denials and ended the call. A most awkward experience to say the least."
 Jesus
 I gotta say man

 Is 'one and done' innuendo
 Matter of context.
 I wrote a report on modeling approaches and I've labelled my preferred approach the 'one and done technique'
 But it's pretty benign and commonly used
 Should be alright. Not like the model is named rail and bail
 Sorta sounds like I'm advocating for premature ejaculation all over TDMs

 Oh yeah there's the the prejac definition too.
 It's a double innuendo

 I would love to see those citations

If not, you can also park at our neighbor's. Just let us know when you're close."
 Ah OK. I could still give the road a shot. As long as there's no ice/snow. The tires are pretty decent for wet traction in moderately warm weather.
 Unless the road becoming a +6inch deep chocolate river?
 Ok. Yeah I got dat 4wd
 I'll have to park on pavement most likely - my car is kinda iffy in mud and snow
 None of that 4wd
" Yeah, I'm not sure how bad it is now, but during the rain yesterday, it was approaching 6in deep chocolate River. Dave and Jim, just let us know when you're close and we'll meet you at a place to park. Butze, you should be good to go."
 Side note: '6 inch deep chocolate river' probably could be a scat porn title.

" Power dumped, hitting the road now"
" Awesome, thanks alex"
" I'll let you know when i get on the road, should be about 30-45 mins from now"
" Alright, heading out now. I'll see you guys in a few hrs"
" Cool, see you guys in a little bit"
 Where should I park?
" Jimmy, Dave's car made it up the hill. It's up to you if you want to try, but it's not problem to drop your car off at out friend's down the hill. Let me know"

 I need to find a gluten free version of the dark pump.
 Thanks! A couple things:  If the dough has already been refrigerated you generally need to increase the pre-bake resting time by about 1.5x to 2x.  Also you may just need to bake it longer.  I've yet to over-cook a loaf.  I use a kitchen scale to weigh the dough beforehand to know how big the portion is.  The book's bake times assume a certain weight.  The time has to be increased if the loaf is heavier.

" Jim, this shortest paths problem I've been working on has brought me to a big data problem. I now have the algorithm so that it can do the calculation graphs with 3-4 thousand nodes and 4-5 thousand edges. The whole calculation takes about 1 min. If I move up to 10 thousand nodes, however, the matrices no longer fit into my computer's physical memory and it freezes. I need to allocate and call memory more efficiently. Any keywords I should look into for solutions? Butze, you have any experience with this?"
" My first thought would be to change the matrix value type, if it's possible to to in MATLAB and you can afford the potential loss of accuracy"
 Are you working with doubles now?
 If you are able to modify to some sort of integer value or a long it would probably be the most straightforward way to use less memory
 Maybe also write out partial matrices
 I wouldn't be sure what to do without looking at the setup in more detail but maybe Sean has better ideas for memory management
 This might help with my first suggestion http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/numeric-types.html?s_tid=gn_loc_drop
 Depends on how much memory you need to cut
 It's not scalable - still a limit to the number of links and nodes you can use with that approach - but if you're confident you won't have >>10k you are probably safe with a type change
 That's a good idea as a relatively simple first hack at it. I think I can definitely drop some precision.
 Thank you
" NP, good luck with that network"
 And I just walked into this conversation like a child that wanders into the middle of a movie.
" Sorry my whatsapp seemed to have been turned off for the past few days.  I'm not sure off the top of my head but guaranteed there is a solution.  Potentially something even built in to the python library if that's what you're using.  There are all kinds of disk-caching techniques that can get around the memory limit problem, I'm sure there must be something available for graph libraries"
" 10 thousand nodes is not a big number though for a graph, so I'm not sure exactly where the memory problem is coming from.  What data are you storing in each node?"
" Yeah, my WhatsApp does the same thing whenever it updates. It stops giving notifications of messages. I'm definitely going to try Jim's idea of more carefully assigning my data types. Yeah, the problem is that I ultimately need to calculate an N x N matrix where N is the number of nodes whose values depend on 3 other N x N matrices. Each entry i,j of each matrix gives me a certain property of the shortest path from i,j if there is one. I'm doing all of the calculations locally in parallel (the iterations of a for loop are evaluated competitively by the parallel workers) and in order to do that Matlab replicates all of the matrices for each of the workers. When that happens the physical memory gets used up really quickly. Matlab had some documentation for this problem that offers a bunch of potential solutions. I was seeing if you or Jim may have known of one off hand to help me down select from the list."
 What are the values in each matrix?  Also is this a known algorithm or something you came up Erin?
 came up with*
 The values in each matrix are currently 64bit floating point numbers. The algorithm for shortest paths is built in to Matlab and returns a shortest path tree. The part I came up with is basically a depth first search algorithm where the entire tree is traversed and properties of each edge are summed and stored along the way to get all of the shortest path's properties.
 Hmm ok yeah so that's gonna yield 800MB per matrix. And if there's 4 total then 3.2GB.  Doable but if the parallel workers are all making duplicate copies then that's definitely gonna be a problem
 Im assuming the 64 bit numbers are distances or edge weights of some sort?
" Yeah, geometric properties of the edges"
 Right now I'm working on making them all 32bit
 Then I might mess around with distributing the matrices or creating what Matlab called a 'data store' or using a function they have called 'mapreduce'
 Yeah the mapreduce approach is typically applied to these kinds of problems I think
 The real dominating factor is the NxN.  When you have sparse graphs you can use a different representation to use less space but not sure that's applicable to your situation
" Yeah, I already have them represented as sparse. Currently there are a lot of infinities in the entries. Maybe I can convert those to 0's as I go. Luckily the values range from 1 to infinity so I can unambiguously reassign zero to any infinities"
" Well technically 0 and infinity occupy the same amount of bits, unless the implementation doesn't allocate any memory for 0 values.  Hard to say without knowing what's under the hood"
 In Matlab they have a function called sparse that 'squeezes all of the 0's out of a sparse matrix to save space'.
 Oh cool
 Dumb question but is your MATLAB distribution 64 bit? No idea how old your machine is but I'd think a research computer would come with at least 8gb memory
 I feel like just having that squared away would eliminate any need to change your script if it's the difference between 3.2 GB and the 2 GB limit of a 32 bit program
" Yeah, my Matlab is 64 bit. I'm actually running on a super high performance computer with 12 CPUs and 24GB of RAM."
 Okay so 12*3.2 kinda bones you
 Yup
 Do you specify the number of nodes in the mapreduce statement?
 I would probably try running it on like 4 cores first
 Youd have a rough idea of how much memory you're trying to assign if it works/fails
 Because 32 bit vs 64 bit probably won't help if 4*memoryUse still runs into memory issues
" Yeah.  Biggest win would come from reducing duplication of the matrices and somehow allowing workers to handle only subsets of the matrices, which is the kind of thing mapreduce tends to do"
" Would definitely look into the datastore library.  Looks like the kind of thing I've seen in the past to handle super big arrays.  Basically you can store the matrix on disk and read a subset of rows/columns into memory, rather than having to read the entire thing"
 Those are all very good ideas. I'm going to try them out. Thanks!

 Tonight I went to the med school formal with the girl I'm dating. I learned that my feelings for this girl are indistinguishable from my feelings for the house I bought. I'm too cold and dead on the inside to bring myself to care about the girls I meet. But I wear a solid good mask.
" Have you been seeing this girl long? I'm definitely no expert, but it can take some time to start to care for somebody just like it takes some time to feel at home in a new house."
" Agree with Alex, it can take time.  But I am more worried about your own mental health.  Feeling 'dead inside' is not normal and very unhealthy.  You should feel free to talk to us any time but also try to get professional help as well.  I have periodically struggled with similar feelings over the past few years and only recently finally decided I am going to do something about it and get help.  It's not a good way to live."
" Well said, Sean. I've also gotten help in the past. I think there's a reason why our group identifies with comics like 'depression parkour'. I don't mean to imply that any of our experiences can be equated exactly. Each person's experience is unique. How's your mindset now, Dave?"
" Thanks for the support. Things have just been really stressful lately, which pulls me to a point where I just avoid emotions. That combined with social anxiety at the formal and being confused by the how carefree her peers seemed basically put me over the edge."
" I'm feeling a bit better now. Although, I'm pretty sure I've been making a poor effort at showing her any affection. And I was particularly detached/sullen Saturday night. We haven't talked since and I'm guessing she's disappointed."
" I can definitely understand.  I've found that social isolation can be a particular hard thing to deal with and overcome.  Especially because it can be self-perpetuating, as in it causes you to feel bad but that in turn can make other people seem even more foreign because it seems like they are living in a different world and can't really understand, which causes you to feel worse, etc.  It's very difficult."
 When it comes to romantic relationships I believe in keeping communication as open as possible.  If you really like this girl and want to make it work I would suggest just being honest with her about what you're going through and how you feel.  It may be difficult for her but it's almost always better to have honest communication than for her to feel like she's in the dark and has no idea what's wrong.  She might be wrongly blaming herself or drawing incorrect conclusions.  You may even find that you feel closer to her after laying it all out on the table.  Maybe not.  But it has worked for me in the past.
" I''ve been thinking about going the honesty route. Although, I just got a splits text. So, I don't know."
 Splits text?
" The 'too busy for a relationship, etc.' Though I know it's because of my emotional unavailability."
" When you spend over two decades learning to remove emotions and building around learning disorders, this is what happens. Works for my job, but completely detrimental for my social life."
" Damn sorry dude that's too bad.  If it were me I would still probably apologize and offer some explanation, just out of courtesy even if it's not going to salvage the relationship."
" Butze's probably right. Nothing to lose doing that. Dave, you should give yourself some more credit for just going to the formal in the first place. That type of stuff can be so overwhelming and exhausting. How do people actually enjoy those things? It's a difficult date night, especially if you just started seeing someone. I definitely would have felt extremely uncomfortable. So definitely give yourself some credit for stepping out of your comfort zone and going at all. Takes some cajones just to be present for something like that, in my opinion at least."
" Yeah I agree, I hadn't even considered that aspect.  I probably would have been uncomfortable as well. It's definitely not an easy thing to do"
" I hope it's not too late to say that I'll be there if any of you guys need me as well. This kind of group text is probably not my preferred venue for sharing, but I'd be happy to talk."
" Also, totally in agreement. Those formal-type events suck multiple bags of balls. Helps a bit if you and the other attendees are drinking heavily."
" Even then, not the easiest to get through"

" Just to lighten the mood for a moment. Also, WhatsApp just notified me with that message that they now have 'end to end encryption', which kinda sounds like a butthole reference."

" Not to change the subject too many times but Sean, are you still in touch with your old boss at growth spark?"

 Longish story but I'm thinking about starting something with a PM of mine
 I'm still in the stage of seeing if it's even doable
 But it would be cool to talk to someone who's running a company now to get an idea of management/overhead and stuff like that
" As we change topics, just want to say thanks y'all for being supportive. I'm think I've put this whole fiasco behind me and it's probably best that it's over. Lotta lessons learned and things to fix."
" Absolutely Dave.  Dating is hard and trying to find someone you're compatible with takes a lot of work and learning, but I know you will find a great girl one of these days.  It's 100% worth it in the end"
" Jim I can definitely put you in touch with Ross, he loves to talk to people.  Just send me your email and I can do an introduction"
" Thanks Sean, that would be great. I still have a ton of research to do on my own but hopefully I can get an idea of how smart/stupid it would be"

 This new article just came out in the times about emotion and masculinity.  I think it's really good and an important topic.  Basically a serious/scientific version of Bill Burr's 'what are you a faaaagg?' joke. Glad to see this making its way into public discourse because I think it's a huge problem and almost no one talks about it. http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/10/education/edlife/teaching-men-to-be-emotionally-honest.html?smprod=nytcore-ipad&smid=nytcore-ipad-share&_r=0
" That's a really great article. It's amazing how much of the discussion overlaps with Bill Burr's comedy. I feel like he has bits that hit on all of the nuances that were mentioned in the article. Also made me think of this great song called ugly cherries I just heard by this band of two drag queens called PWR BTTM. The singer said he wrote it about his struggle to fully accept his being queer and his desire to express himself through drag culture, but if you listen to the lyrics in the context of that article, they pretty much hit dead on how it feels to not be able to express an important part of your being, whatever it is. Kind of like Billy Budd. You guys have to read that in high school? The singer also said that he was thinking of that adage that if you say you're alright enough you'll be alright and whether it could actually be true. So there's a great part where he basically is shouting he's alright in a tone that sounds strained and doubtful. Also there's a face melting guitar lick in the song. Thought-provoking stuff http://youtu.be/KX_tBWLmr1s"

 And damn I can't imagine dropping $70 on pitcher of mixed drink.
" If they're using well, those are some serious margins."
 Ahh that's right
" If it's any consolation, the pitchers and jugs are fucking enormous"
 It's like 10 and 20 drinks
 I feel hungover just thinking about that
" There were like 15 people there, it was a work related happy hour for aru's sister"
 <Media omitted>
 Lol what
 Somerville used to be poor. It's reflected in the construction. There's a lot of wood scrap construction. The kitchen cabinets in the unit had pieces of a chair in it.
 Haha wow
 So basically your building be like... http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view4/2040394/peter-griffin-6-dollar-man-o.gif
 Yep she's special.....

 Haha that's great
 Would be amazing if you could somehow apply it to AI controlled propeller drones
" A ROFLcopter, if you will"
 Haha yeah

 Ooh nice
 OG Kush
 Took another look at Dave's pic. Did not notice the names before but I gotta say I'm a huge fan of whoever decided to label them
 Are they names of the strain of hops or are they like little names for each plant
" Either way, it's pretty great"
 Oh yeah those are strains. Though it would be hilarious if I gave all of them names like Mr poopybutthole.
 That 'dro
 Lol if you ever crossbreed the hops you totally should
 <Media omitted>
 HAHAHA 😂
 So good
 Lol
" All these fancy names for paint colors. Maybe I should get into the paint name game. Autoerotic Asphyxiation Blue and Bukakke White sound like paints you'd wanna slather on your walls, right?"
 Lol
 Just found a water supply pipe embedded within layers of floor I just had removed. Not gonna be one bit surprised if a dead body or two drops out the ceiling.
 Or some stacks of cash if you're lucky
 Most likely stacks of dead mice.
 Will I be seeing all of your beautiful faces this weekend?
 I'll definitely be there
 https://youtu.be/JCKf-bjokiM
 Sweeeet
 I'll be there as well
 Nice!
 My place is available if any of y'all need a place to stay
" Cool, cool"
 I was looking into hotels just in case but I haven't booked anything yet
 Nah don't do that.  We can make it work.  Unless you really prefer to
 Plus there's also my place. The rentable unit is in good. Unless you want full authentic trap basement experience.
 Lmao only if I can load up an all future playlist to sleep to
 Whatever y'all wanna do
 Also was thinking it would be nice to do some kind of activity together other than the party if there's time.  Maybe on Sunday
 What time should we get there btw?
 Umm good question.  Party officially starts at 8.  But I should be around if you want to come up earlier and bro down
 I think I should be free Sunday. Just gotta buy paint at the home depot and load my car with reno waste.
" I should be free to come up earlier and stay for a little while on Sunday. I'm going to stay at my sister's. Normally, my sister's condo would be a good option as a place for all of us non-Bostonian to stay, but this time Kelly has a couple friends visiting for the weekend, so with them and me the pullouts will be full."
 Saturday I'm working so I'll probably arrive just in time rocking some business casual.
" Ok cool.  Well Jim you can plan to stay with me then, or at Daves"
 Although Sean can I crash at your place? I'll be on the tarp game again.
 Well with a sleeping bag.
 Yeah definitely.  One can take the couch and the other can have the air mattress
 Here’s an artist I want to share with you… Hazy Mountains 
""
 I'll plan on staying at your place Sean. I can definitely come early too
 Ok cool!
" Sean, I'll probably be arriving a little before 8 on Saturday. Should come to your place and drop my stuff off or head straight to the party?"
 Probably better to drop your stuff first so you don't have to drive after.  I could leave a key for you to get in. Do you have a Somerville parking pass now?
 OK. I only have a visitor pass for my area. Car still registered in CT. Although it's Saturday at 8 so I should be able to street park at your place overnight. They don't check parking on Sundays.
 Ok.  Yeah as long as they aren't dicks and ticket you before midnight.  I think Courtney already used my pass twice this week so I don't think it can be used again til next week
" I guess I could drop off my stuff off at your place, then park at Otis, uber over to the party."
 Yeah that could also work
 BTW y'all should let Hazy Mountains slide into your ears and tickle your brain balls.
 Hahaha I'll check it out.  Love gettin my brain balls tickled
" Just got this month's Somerville newsletter. Green energy, volunteer planting in green spaces, bike days, and plastic bag ban proposal...... Shit this place just went full retard."

 Just accidentally wiped my phone. What did i miss here?
 Were you listening to the Dude's story? Were you listening to the Dude's story?
" happy birthday, Sean"
 Haha thanks
 Dang I lost all those sweet pics from our last vt trip.
" Sean and Jim, Kelly and some of her friends are planning on going to the Arnold Arboretum tomorrow from around 1130am to 4pm. I was probably going to meet them there on my way into the city if you guys wanted to come too."
" Cool.  I'm not sure if I can go, might have to run some errands during the day"
" Ok, cool, figured I'd float it out there just in case"
 Thanks though
" Dave, I listened to a couple songs from that band you recommended. Very chill. I've only listened to a little bit but it's like a chill-skype-wave fusion"
 Yeah this sounds cool
 The newer tracks have the modern age 80s sound mixed with chill waves. Saxophone
" Nice, also I've meant to tell you guys that satellite radio recently broadcasted a live com truise concert. Dude's really hitting the big time"
 Gonna be seeing the truise live again in New haven may 12.
 Aw sheeut
 Wish he would come back to Boston
 Just left work. Key at your place Sean?
 Yeah I left it in the mailbox

 That shaping tho
 I still think we should start an artisan bread/urban garden for the homeless type charity.
 Yeah I've been trying to get better at shaping.  Been following this guy on Instagram who's a total pro: https://instagram.com/p/BEj92hNBGwO/
 That could be a good idea
 help the homeless and build a personal brand that makes the local baguettes moist.... win win
 Also i like the word 'moist.' There just something about its connotations and pronunciation. Or it's the coffee and sudafed playing drums in my head.
 Hahaha

" So much nostalgia in so few words. You got kazaa, music videos, linkin park"

 Xanga was the shit back in freshman year of highschool
 I know.  It's like a time capsule
 Nice way to look back and cringe real hard
 <Media omitted>
 Obviously
 All thanks to the archive.org wayback machine
 It definitely paints a picture
 Wow. I still have a MySpace page sitting around from back in the day. I'll think I have the security settings at 11. Probably get rid of it when if I run for public office.
 Pics!!!
 And speaking of old stuff. We all graduated high school 10 years ago. Let that sink in for a moment.

 Haha. It's the James for me as well.
 Lmao
 I can see this becoming a thing
 it'd make a sweet t shirt
 or start a gym franchise called James.
 Lol
 I could be the on site personal trainer

 Poor guy
" FYI, I'm co-hosting a party for my graduation in Somerville on Sunday May 22nd.  I know it's a long way for y'all and you were just here for my birthday so I don't expect you to come, but if you want to you are obviously welcome and I'd be stoked to have any of you in attendance"
 Can the Pope's dick fit through a donut?
" Unfortunately, I'm going to be in San Francisco that weekend for experiments otherwise I would definitely be in attendance"
 I should be able to come that weekend. Aru is gonna be away doing her pre-new job travelling and I don't have anything going on in my life
 No prob Alex
 Cool so Dave and Jim I'll hopefully have you both attending which would be rad
" Is there any particular dress code, like jncos and korn t shirts only?"
 Jncos mandatory. Linkin park or staind shirts also acceptable
 Shit I hope I can find my matching vans
 Dress code: 'nu metal chic'

 Goddamn look at that sweet vinyl flooring
 Same flooring that was in aru's first apartment in manhattan
 I wish it was vinyl. The hardwood boxes are just heavy and unweidly.
 Oh damn so it's real deal
 Dat piff
 You can put that shit right on the apartment listing
 1br apartment. All hardwood floors - none of that snicklefritz
" To the best of my knowledge... Af = 'as fuck', as in 'cool as fuck.'  Goals is used as an adjective instead of a noun.  'This shit is goals as fuck'. 100 emoji I believe is just for emphasis.  Like 'times 100' or '100%'"
 Just what the young whippersnappers be saying these days. Trying to stay relevant
 ah now I understand those young girls' tinder profiles
 Yeah the hardwood should help with the listing.
" Also, never knew there were so many baguettes that shop at home depot Somerville."
 Maybe I should be a plumber up here snake some drains and flush some pipes
 Lol

 Lol this is great
 Could really go for some Tinkle Outside the Binkle right about now
 Porchfest seems pretty legit. Does The Living Sleep wanna drop some dope live tunes at an Otis St easement? lol
 Hahaha that would be awesome
 Dave and Jim what are your plans for the weekend?  You can stay at my place Saturday and/or Sunday night if you'd like.  I'm busy tomorrow until 5 or 6 but will be back after that
 I have work until 6 Sat. As of now it looks like I'm rescheduling my date so I should be in the area by 830
" http://getremix.com Just saw this on the interwebs, not sure if it's applicable to Jim"
 I could come up on Saturday as well. I'll probably be able to be up around 7
 Kewl
" Do you have a timeframe for the party Sean? I'm still planning on going to work on Monday, wasn't sure if the party is one of those 8pm to question mark deals"
 It's 5-9
 Okay cool
 it'll be 5-? when the get wet girls show up.
 Lol
 Also... I just accepted a sicknasty job offer from KAYAK. Starting in September.  So looks I'm staying in the Boston area for a while.  Pretty pumped though the company is super cool.
 #datinternetmoney
 Dayum congrats
" that's the travel company sans-Shatner, right?"
 Oh sweet dude
 Good luck at the new gig
 Thanks!
 Shatner is Priceline.  But kayak is now a subsidiary of Priceline
 ah didn't know the priceline negotiator copped kayak.
 i think we need to have a full blown dudes night out on Sat.... which at our age means before 12

 Y'all up to anything for memorial weekend? Got served some Pillsbury flaky pastries so I'm up to a whole lotta nothing.
 I'm going camping with some of Courtney's friends so I won't be around unfortunately
 I'm out in San Diego for a conference this weekend
 Well I guess I'll be solo baking loafs.
 not a euphemism... literally lonely bread baking.
 Dude solo baking loaves is a great time
 Nothing but you and the dough
 I might be able to do something tomorrow Dave. Gotta do some EDA/report writing but Id be up for something in the afternoon if you wanna hang out
 I'm not sure about sun/Mon just yet. Aru is supposed to be back in NYC tomorrow afternoon/evening but idk if she will be up for doing anything what with a 12 hour time difference
 yeah I'd be down to do something in the afternoon like a New Haven adventure.
 I'm in
 It's nice as hell out
 Worst case scenario we could grab some za and drinks at bar
 They usually open giant garage door thing up so it's basically outdoor seating
 <Media omitted>
 and Jim bar sounds like a good idea as long as it's not backroom hidden dance club bar
 Lool nah George isn't here so we can go ahead and avoid that
 Ooh nice loaf what kind is it?
 that 5 minute quick loaf
 pinchin' loafs would make a good bakery name. Or maybe Valsalva's
 Nice.  White bread?
 White bread for now. Slowly easing my way back into bread making. Crust came out nice. Shame I messed up the amount of salt.

" There was also a guy playing a banjo, and two girls dancing with LED-light up hula hoops"

 Should try to deck out the rav4 like this dude's van. Maybe hands paint the word 'Grape' on the side too.
 Damn that thing is sick

 Been following this Instagram lately it's pretty awesome for van stuff http://instagram.com/projectvanlife
 Helping me get amped up for my trip
 Nice. Looks really idyllic. Good thing the photos don't capture things like BO and swamp ass.
 Yeah shitting into a bucket doesn't make as good of an Instagram shot
 And wiping. Looking at some fertile ground for dingleberries. Now that you bring up the bathroom situation. I don't think I could part ways with modern plumbing. I think I'll settle for minimalist living in a small city space.
 Butt wipes are a pretty good solution for dingleberries
 But yeah a tiny house with real plumbing would be cool too
" I might be the Kobe of taking dumps, but Kobe misses shot too. And that's when running water is needed."
 You can always go the 'tiny homes' route
 Get a minimalist space saver
 Bonus points for making it mobile so you can attach to a pickup or something
 Yeah you can get a pretty nice one for less than a down payment on a regular house in New England
 <Media omitted>
 Only issue id have is it would be hard to ever have guests visit
 or shipping container
 I think a lot of them require mostly DIY effort though
 Lol yeah just gotta commit to your small social/family unit
 There was a time when families were all packed into one small cabin bed. And somehow the mother was always cranking out more farmhands.
 Lol yeah I wonder how they managed that
" Saw a spread of free food in the break room, thought no one was around, exclaimed'Oooo weeee' like Mr. PB......VP of finance is standing right behind me"
 Look them in the eye and say 'this little poopybutthole is hungry!'
 That's how you win respect
" haha or it becomes a 'Dave now works at the local gas station, he makes $8.50 an hour, he goes home smelling of gasoline.... when keeping it real goes wrong.'"
 No way dude
 Ct minimum wage is 9.60
 You got this
" Haha lol-ed thinking of actually saying 'this poopy butthole is hungry!' to an upper management type. I don't think they can fire you for something like that though. Did I tell you about that guy who was wiping with ass gaskets at work and then putting them back in the gasket dispenser? Couldn't fire him because he had some kind of religious reason for doing it. You just have to say Mr. PB's a religious figure to you, Dave"
 Mr PB is a long time family friend lol. There was just some awkward small talk in the break room. Um what are ass gaskets? Sounds buttstuff-esq. And they come out of a dispenser?
" Wait, he was wiping his ass with gaskets?"
 OK Google searched. never knew the covers were called gaskets.
 Oh the toilet seat covers
 I literally thought of a gasket like from an engine
 Same. Especially with Alex working in a mech e lab.
 Like why would he use gaskets when he'd have to assumedly sneak into a mechanic drawer with his pants down
" Haha, I don't know now that you mention it if ass gasket is widely accepted nomenclature. A friend of mine once overheard a small child in a public restroom call them ass gaskets and the term just caught on haha"
 I mean technically that child isn't wrong
 <Media omitted>
 ah the junction between ass and bowl
 but that's pretty nasty that the guy was putting the gaskets back in the box. Was he just stuffing them back in or neatly slipping them back in with Hershey stains and all?
 And that's one reason to air dump to
 too*
 I mean I know a lot of other countries don't flush tp
 Maybe he thought the to dispenser came with a neat little garbage at the bottom
 I think just stuffing them back in. I imagine an absolute nightmare scenario for a germaphobe reaching for the protection of a gasket only to be betrayed
 Forever uncleeeean
 Hahaha
 Lol. Curious how did your building find out it it was him?  Was there a memo go around about dookie butter on toilet covers?
 This actually occurred at a friend of mine's company. She works in HR and it was reported to them. At around the same time there was also a mystery person leaving dookies in paper bags around the office. Separate offender who was ultimately fired once discovered.
" Man, double trouble with those duke-related crimes"
 shit on Debra's desk... like a boss
 that came to mind in terms is office turd offences
 of*
 They say acts of that nature usually come in 2's hiiiyyooo
 Lool
 Poop stories are always a riot. The office is probably wondering why I'm laughing in my cube.
 Wow that was quite a convo guys
 Notice my town is covered in signs about parents getting charged if underage kids are caught drinking in the house. Must be that time of year when parents are on vacation and kids throw the classic high school banger.

 So I'm going to India next Tuesday for a week and I've been trying to prepare as best as possible. During my researches I came across this hilarious video of how to use an eastern latrine that I would highly recommend: https://youtu.be/dKkryfdtMNQ
 It's part of a series of instructional videos on how to crap around the world.
 <Media omitted>
 Lol
 So dark and so funny
 Also that toilet video is awesome.  I'm sure you'll have a good poop story or two from your trip
 So I guess I was supposed to help organize my high school class reunion..... whoops
 When I encounter a biscotti I don't get the urge to revisit the James. It's more like damn I need to read some books and switch on the NPR.
 Lmao
 That's the james for late twenties guys
" Also, I tried my hand at cold brew coffee this week and holy shit"
 Tastes great and I'm buzzing my brain balls off
 10/10 would recommend with some fresh artisan loaves
 Lol nice
 Yeah it's real easy to make
" Alex, or maybe Jim, do you know any nice cheap food places in Madison? Need to ford river there."
 Grand Apizza on Main Street is great pizza and pretty standard prices. The simple sauce and Parmesan apizza is my favorite

 My beard/outdoorsman game just isn't up to par
 Clearly the compiler knows this
" Damn, Microsoft is pretty harsh with the error notifications."
 It's pretty mind boggling how many dating profiles sound the same. 'Love to laugh' ect.  Starting to wonder is there a template for their profiles or is there just a horde of cookie cutter basic girls?
 I think it's because they don't read other girls profiles so they think they're being original
 But that would still mean the vast majority of girls still think similarly. Maybe everyone strives toward creating a benign sounding profile that shit just converges toward the same phrases and diction.
 For some reason I'm reminded of the Dave Chappelle stand-up about stereotypes. Like middle class white girls have a genetic predisposition towards enjoying laughter
 Everyone enjoys broadly enjoyable activities
" That and most people probably won't put too many truly personal things on a dating website, so the amount of socially acceptable things to say about yourself ends up being pretty limited"
 But I also don't know shit about social media anymore so who the fuck knows
" I think the majority of people aren't very interesting (remember uconn?) or they are playing it safe by trying to focus on widely relatable things, thinking that will give them the most appeal.  But that's actually not a good strategy.  Better to focus on specific more unique things and appeal to a smaller number of better matched people.  But it takes time to learn that"
" Basically, farmersonly.com is doing it right"
 wwbhwd
 Yeah it's all about that niche appeal
 But I guess for girls on online dating sites it's not necessary to have niche appeal when they'll still receive a bunch of messages/likes/swipes. More important for guys though.
 I dunno I still think it's a better strategy for them.  A hundred irrelevant dick pics isn't very valuable
 Does 'a mouth is a mouth' apply to dick pics?
 lol
" off topic from dating, but Sean, are you still using the 5 minute artisan recipe for your breads or are you on some next level knead formulas."
 I'm using different recipes now.  Moved on to wild yeast sourdough which is requires a longer process
 Ah. Any recipe suggestions for a solid intermediate bake?
 I've been using the book 'classic sourdoughs' but I think the King Arthur website also has some good ones for free

" Oooo weeee if the economy sours with the brexit and our jobs are unscathed, might be a nice time to buddy up and make property investments. Sphincter to asset acquisition might getting a little looser."
 of course property values usually take longer to dip in a crisis. need sustained bad times
 Lol that's thinking
 I'm just content that my line of work tends to pick up during economic crises
 Governments desperate to pay for shit
 Also Sean those pics have been simultaneously awesome and depressing
 I look outside and instead of mountain ranges I see homeless people casually smoking crack next to a run down subway
 Pretty jealous
" toll roads... got that rib sandwich on lock, you gots to come through me"
 Yup. Plus no politician wants to raise taxes these days
 yeah definitely feel a bit for depressed to when I see Sean's pics. Makes me wanna get a tiny house and take Roy off the grid.
 too*
 Lol
 I'm hoping to inspire rather than depress
 It's okay man. The carpet store is pretty comfy
 The carpet store only gets comfy when you reach for off white Persians
 But for real I've been looking into tiny living options. Really want to amass a variety of tiny places in different locations.
 Dude get a van I'll help you mod it
 <Media omitted>
 Still modern plumbing. Running water is the shit.
 HAHAHA
 That was fucking gold
 Srsly would be pretty neat to do something like that
" There was an imgur post the other day with a guy who made an apartment out of 3 shipping containers, was pretty cool"
 And there's a fair amount of people who are into efficient houses with energy/water/gardening all fully self sufficient
 It's been awhile since I did research on that but I think they're called earth ships or something similar
 That's what I'm talking about

 That's a nice lookin loaf
 Is it tough baking bread on the road?
 Nah I'm staying with friends this weekend so they had all the equipment.  Just used store yeast
 Oh nice. Gotta keep those bread skills sharp during your travels
 Yep
 what type of loaf is it?
 Just classic white French boule
 ah classic white balls.
 and that pic looks like it could on the cover of a book.
 Just a Breeze Bread by the Sneaky Baker
 with foreword written by Tony Eveready
 Hahaha
 Love it
" Okay, fuck it. Gonna throw my hat into the bread ring"
 Reading up on yeast culturing now
 Might try a few easy recipes while the yeast is growing
 Awww shit
 Watch jim be dominating all of us in bread making within like a week
 Kneading with one hand while simultaneously hand grinding locally sourced grain with the other and casually carrying a conversation
 Lmao
 Basting that turkey
 Baking seems a lot different from cooking meat tbh
" Butze, that picture you posted of a goat on Idaho is pretty much exactly as I would imagine that state haha"
 Idaho is a pretty sweet place minus the sketchy conservative area in the north. Think the state is usually associated with living off the grid or preferred locale for laying low.
" Also, potatoes"
 yeah the spuds too
 <Media omitted>
 But yeah I know.  It was at a gas station too.  Livestock just wandering around
 Lol I was secretly wondering what the goat was about
 Thought I missed something
 Nope I just have to post every photo twice because you're a damn Luddite hahaha
 ah Luddite one of my fave pejoratives

" Oh speaking of tiny houses, there's an entire show on HGTV devoted to them"
" Tiny house, big living"
 Found out about it the other day
 I've thought of mortgaging a set of prefab tiny houses in a vacation type area ie Ludlow and renting then out
 though vacation rentals is a fickle business especially with climate change.
 And I think I need to take a gander at that rosebud house lol
 A lot of the ski resorts seem to be struggling to survive these days
" ole fashion primary living space is the safest bet. Seen some tiny house community concepts, but they resemble trailer parks. But trailer parks aren't they the o"
 OG tiny houses. Just associated with being poor.
 Poor is the new rich
 So it's rebranded for the progressive folks.
" kinda like peasant loafs, uncovered brick walls and loose hanging Edison bulbs"
" Yeah I mean pretty much everything cool today is derived from being poor a century ago.  Making your own food, living small, etc"
" Yeah the whole internet cottage industry, handmade, local grown is what the majority of people did back in the day.... well minus the internet part"
 Just add wifi and 3d printing to early 1900s poverty and you've got yourself a bohemian comminity
 I've been searching for this NPR segment about local grown stuff and how it doesn't solve any world problems. It's the most inefficient easy to make crops to supply an ever growing population.
 Basically we're taking steps backwards to be cool when society has reached a point where we can't be dicking around with small scale personal pizza shit
 Yeah.  It's not about efficiency though it's more about entertainment.  People who do it i.e. us can afford the premium
 My sourdough loaves probably take $100 of labor at least.  Not efficient in the least but fun as hell
" Assuming you're working your hourly rate, yeah"
" If you can fill 100% of your free time with work at-rate, that's the loss you take"
 But it's not always the case
 Welp remember those beers I've have y'all.... it's gonna cost you lol
 No even for a baker's wage to bake just a few loaves a week would be about that expensive
" But again, not about the efficiency in these cases"
 You mean in terms of what it would take to survive with that amount of production? Definitely true in that case
" yeah if you factor in the oven, the building the oven is in and other normally overlooked costs it'd definitely come out to at least $100"
" Artisan is such a weird thing, but it has a quality that's probably important culturally"
 We have to balance industrial thinking with holistic evaluation occasionally
 For me I just find fulfillment in making things and learning how things are made.  Mass production is efficient but if that's all you consume it doesn't lead to a particularly interesting or fulfilling life IMO
 Need a balance as Jim says
 Like if I had to make everything myself that would not be very fun
 I like making things but I like making things in mass. Probably why I enjoy how it's made and plumbuses
 I guess I guess I'd everything was super lickety split efficient works would be very Soviet and cog life.
 if*
 Yeah efficiency isn't everything
 Some of the best things in life aren't efficient.  I.e. Wrapping a turkey in a bacon weave
" For me balance would be society delegating resources to provide guaranteed proper resources water, basis food and shelter in the most efficient, industrial way possible.... establishing a baseline. Then amassing more or seeking creativity, personal growth is dicking around you can do on your own accord"
 You should work for the government.  Sounds like you have good macro-level ideas.  I tend to just focus on my self and hope the big picture works itself out via a plague or other catastrophic event
 it's all motivated by self preservation.  I fear the proletariat as Marx calls them. It's programmed into my family history.
 wish I could figure out a way to nip the whole class struggle problem in the bud before it gets out of hand
" You guys are pretty much outlining the main theme of my dissertation, efficiency versus creativity. Efficiency is typically associated with uniformity and limited interaction whereas creativity depends on the interaction of a diverse set of things, whatever they may be. In the most optimal case, there's a balance where efficient structures facilitate creativity. The bronchioles in the lungs are a good example. Straight, uniform tubes branch and decrease in radius efficiently transporting air to oxygen absorption sites, which are exactly inefficient with respect to moving air, but amazingly effective at getting oxygen because their surfaces are so nonuniform and textured. It's all about efficiently bringing diverse sets of things together in a productive manner with minimal loss of each entity's unique character along the way."
 http://giphy.com/gifs/tim-and-eric-mind-blown-EldfH1VJdbrwY
 That's amazing
 Blew my mind too. That little piece of math that James showed me lead to a whole derivation that made the lungs thing clear to me
 Fuckin algebraic
 Literally
 That's one hell of an analogy... wow
" I definitely think the food industry suffers from the downside of industrialization these days, probably why artisan foods are so popular. Although most of the ire seems to be directed at the least problematic things that were doing to foodstuffs"
" We could benefit from some more food bronchioles, is what I think I'm saying"
 Or maybe from more studies of evolution in design
 as long as those bronchioles aren't asthmatic and deliberately limiting airflow
 There was a really cool study of urban growth that involved modeling cities with mold colonies
 One of my grad student friends was working on it. Horribly boring day to day but a really neat end result
" The food industry also gets the benefit of efficiency with respect to food sanitation. Just came back from India where the food is amazing, all 'home-cooked' style, but it'll give you horrible shits. I was like a faucet for a week and I took all the precautions. Really need to strike a balance somehow. Also that's really cool with the mold study. I saw people using that analogy to model empty planes getting reforested in that show cooked. Somehow it seems to make sense that it would also be applicable to city growth"
 Definitely look forward to hearing some of your (probably poo related) stories from india
" I'm guessing immune systems play into that too, or at least similar tolerances. Aru says she has to be super careful eating food in India, and she was born there"
 But her family that's lived there their whole lives have no issue
 Intestinal flora is like an island with some shared species with the people in your area (basis of the poop transplant). Go to another place and you got totally different species. Those new bacteria in the gut are like north American field mice making it to Australia... buffet.

 No going to Washington and then to Banff in Alberta then Montana
 Really wanted to do the southwest but it's too damn hot there right now

 Are you gonna decide to keep it real ?

 I told them it means world peace
 Yeah it's about to turn in to that. Actually pretty pissed I'm left with the holding down clinical stuff with the techs while the rest of the office is meeting with the vendor.
 Fuck I'm about to straight lead a revolt.

" Ah, so more like this Rick and Morty clip"
 <Media omitted>
 Srsly though it's probably a good idea to remind them not to treat you and the techs like indentured servants
 I'm more concerned about the techs they get paid a lot less but hold down a shot ton
 shit* of important work. Struggling here to bring balance to the workplace.
 And yeah that scene from Rick and Morty sums it up.

 Dave I know it's super far for you but would you want to come over to Brooklyn for the 4th?
 You're more than welcome to
" It's just gonna be me, the twins, and 4 or 5 of their friends"
 Alex you're welcome to come too. I assume you're in VT or Madison but you can definitely come down
" Sean, I assume you're on the other coast."
 Yeah I'm in Seattle 😢

 And there's a snorlax
 A little app called PowerPoint
 Woooow
 Also in the mountain
 Oh man bottom left too hahaha
" Yeah, that one gets me every time"

 Nice job!
 Is that some kind of braid
 Thanks
 oh shit someone got fancy
 Lol
 Yeah I decided to give it a go
 Boule is difficult to eat for me cos I apparently only own shitty dull knives
 Just winged the braid
 Nice
 First attempt did not go as well but I blame my old ass bake ware
 Bits of my baking sheet came off in the bottom crust of the boule
 Dave helped me with the dough making on this one. Dat giant costco bag of flour
 Looks like the gauntlet has been thrown down. Gonna have to step my game up when I get home.
 Looking forward to dat bake off
 We'll have to try out some recipes for Alex's bread stove
 think I'm gonna pick up a different niche cooking activity.... maybe pickling
 Bake off would be awesome
 I gotta say I like the brewing/baking combo you got going on
 Nice synergy
 But yeah would also be good to round out the portfolio with more niche skills
 You add in some pickles and maybe some smoked meats and you've got yourself a nice picnic
 Thinking about trying cheese and butter
 then we can open an artisan goods shop in some gentrified area
 We could start our own commune at that point
 get some San serif font packaging
 Jams/preserves are a hot ticket item as well
 Aw yeah
 Get some chutneys up in this bitch
 Seriously though I'm excited to hang out with you guys again
 It'll be a good time catching up

 the beauty of fermented/preserved foods is their increased shelf life. Though at the expense of longer/riskier lead time.

" Had to call up a guy after denying his wife's medications. Was unhappy he had to pick up an OTC made in Japan. Guy went on a nativist rant about immigrants receiving free benefits and what not. My mind drifted off to thoughts of similar people in a mass, current and past upwellings of populism and the consequences.... not surprised by his sentiments but it left me with a sinking feeling regarding humanity."
 Well at least there's always Pokemon
" Also, just want to share that I had the opportunity to shit in the woods twice this weekend during a two day backpacking trip with my dad and his coworkers. Amazing and recommendable experience. Very liberating. Butze, have you tried it yet? Also, we should do a section of the long trail some time soon. Can't believe I didn't try out backpacking earlier. So fun"
 amazing referring to backpacking or releasing the chocolate dragon in the woods?
 Both and now also to calling it 'releasing the chocolate dragon' hahaha

" Jim, is that feasibility study for CT mileage tax something you'll be doing?"
 Not me specifically
 But my company is
 ah. so there won't be reports with a picture of you giving a double thumbs up.
 that's how I imagine your feasibility reports ending for clients
 Usually is
 Always thought the wacarnolds rib sandwich toll strategy would be best. Mileage tax just seems about as annoying as old school electric/gas meter reads.
 We have problems with the mileage tax tbh
 If it replaces gas tax it doesn't favor one type of vehicle over another
 No incentive to reduce emissions or increase fuel efficiency
 right. long distance heavy commuters would be hit the hardest.
 Yeah
 Tolls still look like the best alt on my end
 Can offer programs for commuters on facilities
 so then you should change your Altima to a Hummer
 And free alternatives
 yeah those no booth tolls on mass Pike are pretty sweet. Alternatives like CT fast trak? Seems like a good amount of people actually use it.
" Sup yallll 😄 just got back on the grid again.  Courtney and I were backpacking in the Canadian Rockies for 3 days.  To answer your question Alex yes I have shit in the woods, a few times in Colorado and it is awesome.  Surprisingly the two places I've been backpacking though have both had outhouses at the campsites so no hole-squatting there"
 Probably because they're national parks and they want to reduce impact on the environment.  Human dookie all over the place isn't great I guess
 Sounds like a pretty rad time
" Sean, are you still in mid-travelling, or are you back in the northeast?"
" Still traveling, returning in early August then going on a couple short trips.  So I'll see y'all Labor Day weekend hopefully"

 Oooo he's tryin!
 Hahaha sure am
" So who's in for Hops in the Hills? It's August 6th and I'll be going up to VT on the 4th. Sean, I think you said you're traveling, but I figured I'd double check. Also, Jim, feel free to bring Aru if you're able to come. Dave, you should see the new brew equipment my dad's picked up. It's gettin serious haha"
" Aw man I really wanna come for that.  Leaving Montana on August 1st and was estimating I'd be back in mass on the 7th.  I guess there's a chance if I activate Wu-drive I could make it, but probably not super likely"
 :/ that's the weekend I fly out for my vacation
 Hope you guys enjoy though
 Jim's taking a vacation?? 😮
 2 vacations actually 😅
 Though the second one is just to spend time with my parents/my dad's birthday
 Damn son
 Nice
 I'm on call that weekend and I'll be in Somerville for some final clean up with for the rental.
 Also I saw the Cascade brick your dad posted on fb. Wish my poopy butthole hops plants made that much hops flowers. Is he making an IPA?

 Started reading the issue. Interesting to get the farmers perspective on food and their struggles.
" Cool.  There's also a pair of articles outlining the global vs local food debate, very similar to what we were discussing a while back"
 Is the magazine also full of ads for super niche products?
 I always enjoyed the advertisements for specific brands of manhole covers and blind pedestrian crosswalk location bumps
 I'll have to check
 <Media omitted>
 nothing really niche. It's not really an ad driven magazine. Looks like it's funded by various Canadian agricultural commission
 so that technique works with pubes too right. Remember 'the hobbit' from urban dictionary.

 You probably could benefit from a tabby wreaking some havoc
 I think he got adopted though
 ah bummer. Should've took it home with you after buying it dinner.
 It hopefully at least has a better life now
" Plus I'm not gonna leave a cat alone in an apartment for 3,4 days at a time"
 It ain't right
" true. Cat probably would've gone to town on your apartment. Could always take it to work as a 'therapy animal', let it loose on clients you don't like."
 Office cat?
 Or enhance presentations with a cat
 Really should design some app based remote pet care devices
 yeah like a roomba
 Just have a roomba mouse I can activate with my phone
 Maybe a cat feeder and waterer

 Lol I am. Aru is really excites about the whole foods being opened
" I gotta say though, I have no idea how some of those businesses on Bedford survive. A surprising amount of weird artsy junk still being sold"
 Most likely running at a loss. They'll get replaced by upscale chain. The non well heeled artsy folk and hipsters will then flock to the next cheap area.
" Word on the street is Bronx is next. Large number of permits being issued in some areas... not sure how long this growth will sustain though... like yeast in bread, there's a limit to the number of CO2 bubble condos."

" btw labor day is still on right? Because if it is, Sean, I may need your help with picking up some freshly choked out chickens in Cambridge."
 I'm definitely still in for Labor Day
 Shweeeet
 Been dialing in a new sourdough recipe in preparation
 ooh nice. And Jim do you still have that bacon wrapped pineapple jammed in a chicken's ass recipe?
 <Media omitted>
 Hahaha
 'Backdoor Baguettes'....YouTube bread baking channel. Tons of closeup shots of the dough and hype man interjections.

 I've still got the swineapple recipe in my back pocket

 Hot damn
 Oooo weeee
 Labor day's comin up quick
 Hope ur hungry
 per usual I'll be showing up with a bulge of meats
 trying to find a fresh choked heirloom pig from a local farm
" We do need a pig, right? I'm assuming a suckling pig should have a large enough cavity for a pineapple."
 Hahaha
 That will be so epic if you roll up with an entire pig
 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mZE9fJ-ER0M
 You can get those whole pigs with the box used to smoke it
 Sort of like a keg but with meat
 Well looks like the Berkshire strain of baby pigs are not available at the nearby farm. Only got some lean strain piglets. Good news for them because I won't have to make eye with their eater.
 But I can still pick up some OG strain back ribs and loin chops from local meat dealer.
" All we would need is a rack of boneless ribs or a pork loin. We don't have to do swineapple btw, it's just something else to bring to the table"
 I'm just excited to try my burger recipe again
 <Media omitted>
 haha

 Sean Paul
 Haha awesome. Why is 'Patriots' in quotes? Is the mascot meant to be ironic?
 Haha I have no idea
 There's also a noticeable lack of laser beams in the background of what appears to be a school portrait used on the ID.
 also 50 cent's in da club just started playing in my head

" Hey Sean, is Rob coming up this weekend?"
 Thinking of making a meat whishlist for the the labor day wknd
 'meat wish list' lol
 Yeah I'm pretty sure he's gonna come
 Was planning to bring Courtney too if that's cool with everyone
 Cool with me
" Dave, would you want to group up at Costco before we head up?"
 She said she'll contribute a dish or two.  Maybe a desert and a vegetable
 I'm cool with that as well
" Was thinking burgers, some sort of steak, and the pig/pineapple turducken"
 I think I don't think I have to work that day but I could def carpool if you want to do that
 Hmm maybe I could leave early depending on how much I have to do
 Maybe we should map out a build order for the weekend like last New Years haha
 For Courtney we could try doing some legit veggie burgers
 Been trying to dial in a recipe based off of some I've tried in the past
" I was thinking burgers for lunch, maybe with some homemade sourdough buns?"
 She's not vegetarian FYI unless you just wanna do em for the lulz
 Steak/swineapple dinners with that brown boule
 Oh nm I thought she was
 My b
 oh then no need to dial back the meat
 But she has a farmshare right now so she gets a crate full of local veggies every week so we could bring tons of good shit
 I could still try. The veggie burgers are as good as any meat burgers I've had in the past
 Kale fennel beets heirloom tomatoes and shit
 What kind of veggies does she have access to
 Ah
 Heirloom tomatoes are where it's at
 This season has been shit for mass produced grape/cherry tomatoes
 It's different every week
 So won't know til a couple days before
 That lootcrate
 Fruitcrate
" Sean, you have a bread wishlist?"
 Or a build order
 Haha not really.  Just been working on perfecting this 50% whole wheat sourdough recipe which is pretty versatile.  Not sure if I wanna do anything additional bc the process is so time consuming
 I'll think about it though.  There's different things you can still do with the same dough
 Very true
 Other ppl are welcome to make some as well
 my bread baking skills are not up to snuff.
 I'm confident I can keep us supplied with loaves
 pinching loaves
 that's the type of loaves I'll be making with the amount of food we're consuming
 Haha
 There's a police presence at Costco because a group of protestors plan on wearing hazmat suits and dumping blood on themselves in the meat section
 Lol wow
" Check out Montieth and the new dorm at UConn. They put up these video tours on YouTube. The guy moves kind of slow, so you have to fast forward https://youtu.be/kcff9HxcTIE"

 Monteith Sneak... all the way up in yo ass via student loans
 Hahaha
 waiting for Tony Eveready to donate big to the school and rename the building
 But I'm also kind of jealous that we graduated right before uconn stopped being totally shitty.  Coulda been gettin froyo and sushi on the reg
 Those kids will never know about skeletons closet
 Nope
 Weird that South is probably the shitty dining hall now
 kinda like gentrification of dorms
 I wonder if there plans to update the alumni dorms
 And McMahon is the best dining hall now. Total flip. And they're tearing down the grad dorms across from the coop. Doesn't look like they're doing anything with alumni
 blow down since walls so there's open concept dorm living where everyone can see you wamk it
 wank*
 Haha
 Things done changed
 they probably also need a shitty dorm to dump honors kids... Butts toured the facility if I remember correctly
 They've improved the place so much that I might be fooled into sending my spawn there in the future.
 Having an existential crisis. Who wants pheasant and rack of lamb along with OG oinks?
 Haha wait are you having an existential crisis about the meat selection or wanting to buy meat because of said crisis?
 I also am unclear on Dave's statement
 I'm buying meat because of said crisis. Sometimes life makes you want to you buy a serious meat spread. Because life.
 Dave bb r u ok?
 A family friend was recently murdered. So I've been lost in thoughts about the Sisyphean struggle of life. I'm glad we're all still alive.
" Shit Dave, I'm so sorry. It's never easy to deal with news like that"
 I hope the family is able to cope. I hope you guys are too
 Wow so sorry to hear that.  That's terrible.
 Well I'm looking forward to seeing you all.  Hopefully spending some time together will be positive /helpful for you (via bros 4 life).  I will be sure to bring good vibes
" Yup, it'll be all good vibes and meat sweats"
 Ah sorry for dropping a real bummer into the chat. But definitely looking forward to this weekend and some good times.
" Current my meat list: 2 Berkshire pig back rib racks, 2 pheasants (maybe 3, they're smallish birds), large slab of Berkshire pork butt. May end up be subbing with Angus/dry aged steaks or fresh chickens or whatever distracts me at the meatman shop"
 Damn that's quite a build order
 Alex is the wood oven ready for use? If so we should plan to make some kind of pizza or flatbread for one meal
 😮 gonna need to bring some fiber one for this trip
 good idea it'll be like dunking a beach ball after these meals
 I'm glad you can share with us tho Dave. Always happy to talk with you guys
 Let me know if it makes sense for me to bring up stuff separately/split the meat load
 It seems like a lot
 Never cooked pheasant or pork booty before
" Pork butt is same as pork shoulder, so typically you slow cook it to make pulled pork"
 yep that's the plan... maybe pulled pork pizza
 👍
 Hoo wee
 yeah pheasant not to sure. might just opt for fresh chicken's
 2 of them and try different styles
 See what kind of weird shit we can stuff up their butts
 We could do Dutch oven chicken
 The brick oven is operational
 we're gonna need some high quality BBQ sauce. Dunno if I should pick up a Costco jug of sweet baby rays
 <Media omitted>
 haha
 or if someone has some artisanal smash your grandma BBQ sauce
 smack*
 Stubbs is really good
 I'll end up making a BBQ sauce infused with pork souls during the cooking process though. A good base sauce is useful but not required
" Jim, do you want to carpool up to vt?"
 Sure dave
 I'm out of work 5 on Friday
" I'm still working out how this week is gonna be, I'm trying to fit in a wfh on Friday so we can head up earlier"
 Dat WFH
 oh now I got the acronym

 what's the head count? so I can determine how to scale the meat pick up
 Courtney can't come unfortunately but Rob is coming
 Bummer dude. it'll be a dudes night out

 Haha damn good times at red rock
 http://tinyhousetalk.com/adventurous-couples-diy-school-bus-motorhome/
 magic school bus
 Fuck yeah
 This is more or less my life game plan
" That tiny house, big living?"
" Always wondered how you'd power something like that. Do they have to find a place to plug into, or do they have some detachable solar power deal"
" Not sure, possibly both.  Usually you'd have a generator on board but also the ability to plug in when you go to rest stops and campgrounds"
" Electricity comes from three solar panels that charge batteries hidden beneath the bus. A 12-volt system powers the LED lighting and appliances, and a 110-volt system runs the outlets. “We use as much power as we want,” Pelletier says. "
 Huh. Pretty impressed with that
 Nice
 Though I'm still more inclined towards fixed house living (modern plumbing) and to do something like this
 https://valhallamovement.com/learn-how-this-family-grows-6000-lbs-of-food-on-just-110th-acre/

 You guys feel like doing a little hike in the woods this weekend like last time?
 Yeah definitely
" Nice, I'm going to see if I can find some new trail options to check out"
 Cool
 Gotta offset the massive calorie intake
 Gotta make my dating profile feel legitimate
 Though I get the feeling the need may be ending soon.
 Oh yeah? You been seeing someone?

 Oooh shit son
 Ahhh booyah
 Do you guys have any interest in kayaking? My parents and uncle pay are going either Saturday or Sunday and they said they'd reserve us kayaks too if we wanted to go.

 Awesome
 btw Sean how's that new Priceline negotiator job going.
 I start on Tuesday
" Ah. Well if the Shatner wants you to watch him negotiate a wank, don't break eye contact."
 Haha
" Alright got the farm veggies, we got: kale, mixed greens, parsley, 1 green bell pepper, 3 jalapeños, 1 large eggplant,  1 cucumber, celery and 1 tomato"
 Can probably do a salad and also use some for pizza toppings
 Aahhh sheeeeuuuuttt

" just picked up some serious meats from Meatman: 2 racks of baby back ribs, pork shoulder and 2 chickens."
 <Media omitted>
 Lol nice
 Which one are we eating this wknd?
 Just a pic from the local farm. Unfortunately I didn't get to look the pig on the eyes. But it's one of these types of oinkers
 pretty sure if I got to know the pig personally... we'd be eating vegetables and I'd have a pet pig in my backyard.
 so Jim should head down to your place after work? ETA 530
" Jim, how are we doing this carpool thing....Need to know... like Marc Anthony"
 Lmao
" I was just gonna text you, been super busy this morn"
" Head to my place after work, I'm gonna get out around 515-530 and should be home by about 545"
" Sean, are you carpooling with Rob/when are you heading up?"
 Yeah I'm driving us up.  Probably leaving around 6 or 7
 Ok cool
 Gonna be late to new Haven. Got a weird case to wrap up before I leave work
" Aw damn, just got out of work myself"
 Oh btw are you guys still interested in having steak this wknd? I can head to the co op to see if they have any good meats
 damn we really gonna flip the dick down this weekend
" I can wait for you, Dave, if you wanna take a look at the potential meats"
 I'm guessing eta 6 depending on traffic
 Also I wan a make sure you have space in your cooler
 <Media omitted>
 Awesome
 Haha sweet
 I'm gonna grab some ny strip steaks
 How much meat do you have so far?
 Also wanna get hamburger meat but we can get that in vt
 Also we probably have a good 20 pounds of meat by now
 no need to keep track....it's just a breeze
 Just got 5 ny strip steaks
 Lol @ flip the dick down
" Haha aahhh sheeeuuutt, I think I'm getting anticipatory meat sweats"
 Can't wait to watch Jim freak that bitch out
 At rob's now bout to head out
 Probably 10:15-10:30 arrival
 Sounds good
 btw everyone Chris is getting married today..... meditate in that.....
 <Media omitted>
" Thanks for coming up guys! Another successful, meat-filled extravaganza."
" Sean, I think you may have left your preserves. We can mail them to you. Just let me know your address"
 Yeah what a rad weekend!

 Looks amazing
" Dude you should totally open a bakery....fluff up the brand via social media, hire cheap the labor, rapidly expand to multiple locations, go public, pump the stocks, and cash out before the business becomes a fiery wreck....you know that simple artisan dream."
 Lol
 I was just crunching some numbers actually.  Making a ton of assumptions but I think it would be possible to clear maybe 50k a year as a one man operation if you could do 100 loaves per day 5 days a week
 Not exactly internet money but you could live
" Gotta make it cash only.  Maybe entirely internet based bread order/delivery.  Forgo store front, so you can avoid paying for desirable location."
 Yeah that's a good idea
 One person I follow on Instagram does a monthly bread share program similar to a farm share.  60 bucks a month for 2 loaves every week.  That's about $7 per loaf
 Wow. Shipping costs must be high. Bread has extremely low shelf life.
" Never tried it, but I wonder if vacuum bagging bread increases shelf life"
 Then again it's a moisture issue. Maybe plan and freeze months of 80% cooked loafs. Then finish them before each shipment. It's 'fresh'
 http://qz.com/571151/the-mast-brothers-fooled-the-world-into-buying-crappy-hipster-chocolate-for-10-a-bar/
 Just remember that thick beard of yours helps cover up artisanal corner cuts.
 Lol
" It's pick-up only, no delivery"
 Shelf life too short for delivery
 Without preservatives you got like 24 hrs basically
" Hmm...I guess you could sell frozen half baked loafs with cooking instructions. Then the buyer just needs to complete the baking process for fresh homemade artisan bread. It'll be like is that delivery or Digiorno? Nah, the Sneaky Baker be giving your wife baguettes and boules while you're at work."
 Yeah I dunno half baking is a little sketchy
 Ain't nothing sketchy about compromising your art so you can improve the reliability of your supply and make mo money.
 Lol I think you're kinda missing the point
 It would be difficult to find the right point to stop baking and flash freeze. Like a sweet spot that preserves moisture and structure.

 What do you do with all the loafs you bake? Seems like you're cranking out at least 1 daily.

 Good idea.  Existential baking

" Was thinking isn't the concern of music artists not being paid enough related to supply and demand. Recording equipment and computer software is so accessible that countless bedroom musicians have sprung up. The market is overwhelmingly flooded with producers and there products. Also there are a multitude of distribution methods (traditional physical copies, YouTube, SoundCloud, Bandcamp, torrent sites, Spotify). When supply is tipped to such extreme, prices would approach zero. Just find the situation to be basically individuals refusing to adapt to the changing market and acknowledge the game done changed."
" So music track themselves really are worth $0.0001a play or approaching free via pirating. And the artist doesn't make tracks to profit directly. But instead creates tracks/songs to grow their brand, which is then leveraged for profit via shows, endorsements, etc."
" Just my musings with caffeine coursing through me. Maybe, Sean, as a someone with commercial releases and interactions with smaller artists could provide an opinion."
" I've often thought about the revenue model for music streaming sites. With things like YouTube or Pandora/Spotify with advertisements, ad revenue can be directly tied to an individual artist's popularity. With a paid streaming service, it's that much more of an indirect correlation between popularity and sales, and you don't get a feel of an individual fan's willingness to  pay for additional goods/services/ad products. Seems like individual artists with a significant amount of fans (like Beyonce and Kanye with that whole tidal thing) can hold sway over the market"
 I personally still like the band camp/ad supported method of selling IP
 Yeah I dunno I don't really know whether it's harder or easier for artists to earn a living today.  Probably easier than 10 years ago at least when distributors hadn't caught up to the technology yet.
 It gets complicated whenever a small number of ppl control distribution of something though because they can basically drive the price down by being the only means of getting your product sold.  So hard to say whether a stream is really 'worth' what an artist is paid for it
" Depends on what your beliefs are about Capitalism, the one True God of America"

 All these voice assist devices from tech companies.... Looking forward to being able to yell out 'play that nuts coming out of the ass sound' and every room reverberates as the foomp sound blasts out a house-wide speaker system. The future is exciting.

 Artisanal oatmeal.....
" Love the quote, 'my horse would LOVE this!' Haha, just saw the voice assist post too. Hilarious."
 I'm sold.  Sounds delicious
 Haters gonna hate
" Yeah I gotta admit I'm intrigued. Some of the flavor blends sound dope. Though the health conscious part is a bit false, most of the options will probably be loaded with fat and sugar unless you get stock oatmeal."
 But you gotta give the people what they want. Like that UConn student union salad place that masqueraded as a healthy option. Or people just assumed plants equates healthy even if it's floating in a bucket of ranch dressing.
 Isn't oatmeal big in Germany?  Over the summer in Canada this German guy came into a cafe and tried to order oatmeal and was very disappointed when they said they didn't have any
 Some form of porridge is big in every culture. But I think we shy away from it nowadays because of modern package breakfast foods. It would be cool if someone opened a multi ethnic porridge shop.

 Hey Sean amongst your tech coworkers how many own condos in the Boston area? Or Alex dunno if you know if the majority of your sister's coworkers own in the Boston area?
 Reason I ask is because my street had a recent jump in sales with a bunch of places gutted and condo converted.
 I'm not sure.  My team is on the older side.  The two guys close to my age both rent.  Everyone else owns homes in the burbs.
 Hmm... I'm trying to figure out who are the folks buying up multi family condo converts.
 May have to do the same on my place. Cash out while the economy is at peak before the cycle begins down swing/recession
 Yeah I dunno.  Probably a tough call.  Seems like property values could climb way higher as gentrification expands into east Somerville
 Yeah in planning on holding at least another 1.5 years. When the sales on my street and the neighboring streets go through I'll probably dump it.
 Then again o need to access how resilient prices in the area were during the last recession
 Give er the ol 'pump n dump'
 Yep
" I think the same thing is happening in South Boston where my sister lives. Especially near her condo there are a number of newly converted and new build condos. Just walking around the neighborhood, you'll see a lot of people who are our age with young kids who most likely work in the seaport. Kelly has said that she knows a number of people at her work who also live in south Boston. So it could be a bunch of 'Kellys' buying up condos in Somerville"
 http://gis.vgsi.com/somervillema/Search.aspx
 Get at that property data from a semi objective source bro
 It won't tell you some of the why behind the sales but you can see larger trends if you cast a wide net
 Yep. I'm running all the addresses on my street. Thanks
 Np
 You can search the street without the number as well. I tried a blank search and it just dumped out all the records in the database
 Ooooo weeee
" You want I should build a web crawler to scoop up all that sweet, sweet property dat"
 Data?*
 I've been looking for projects to add to my portfolio that are sorta unique
 That's be awesome... Game done changed
 Nice
 Wow so my old building is worth just shy of 1 mil.  They bought it in 1984 for $80k
 Also lol @ 'bunch of Kelly's'
 I'm just imagining Kelly taking over Somerville lol. Driving hard bargains.
" I think we let our powers combine, then captain planet."
 ...I think if we combined our know how we could make a mark in real estate
 I don't doubt it haha
 Also I think if Sean's old building condo'ed out it could easily 1.4 million. Four unit multi in Somerville is slow ramp for investors

" Well it looks like I'm getting a Toyota Camry. Really enhances my personal brand...'Bitch, I get 33 m-p-g... That's like a $300 annual savings. I could take you out for a few moderately priced dinners or add that to my Roth'"
 Is your accord getting up there in mileage?
 Hahaha 'add to my roth'
 Not quite. There's a motor oil burn problem. It's kinda of a problem fit this generation of accord. And I'm out of the warranty years and mileage limit. So probably best to trade it in while there's still value and avoid potential engine repair work.
 For*
 Eh makes sense. A lot of cars with moderate to high mileage have that issue. You could check the (ass) gaskets to see if you have a good seal still. Otherwise yeah you either trade it in or add some oil every couple weeks
 Haha ass gaskets.
 But yeah the piston ass gaskets are the origin of the problem. Plus my car is up for a new set of tires and there's also a defect causing premature rear break wear.  I just don't see this car being designed to hit 200k like the usual expectation of Hondas
 Well neither of those problems are bad enough to end a cars life on their own
 More like car AIDS - the resulting complications will destroy the car if not properly managed
" Yeah definitely car AIDS. Brakes are tolerable, but the engine bit is unacceptable. There's been a lawsuits over the issue already. Don't really got that kind of time to take the car to the dealer for major servicing and possibly forking out serious dosh for a bandaid solution."
" Btw, Sean when you got your rav4 in MA, did you pay the sales tax and excise tax in the same year?"
" I think the excise tax was prorated, so I paid for the remaining part of the year"
" Ah. And from what I'm reading excise tax is used in lieu of individual town prop tax like in CT but fixed to a 2.5% rate, right?"
 As far as I know the excise is the only tax you pay on the vehicle other than sales tax
 Hmm there's much to weigh... Wish I lived in the city and could get rid of the car.

 So tableau hot shit for you data magician types? Like for making snazzy reports and slapping the big data dick on lay folks like me?
 So is*
 Companies hiring seem to like it. Shits expensive as fuck tho so I wouldn't know
 I mostly use excel and shiny
 Oh. The new company claims processing software will be delivering me reports made from tableau.
 I watched the see it in action vid on their webpage. Looked super cool according to the twenty- something working on a Mac and making reports for a indie coffee roaster
 Tableau seems decent from what I've seen. Good visualization software but it's mostly fancy formatting and polish IMO. Best used for report graphics and presentation slides you can point at while the boardroom applauds
 So it's that high quality lube for the big data dick
 Though you don't need lubed up data to show tablea's lackluster stock price after a hyped NYSE listing.

 Interesting demographics
 The concord office is
 Cambridge is younger
 Ah the create two kids and realize your city condo is too small so you trade up to the burbs situation.
 Life?
 Yeah.  Everyone in concord talks about maintaining their lawns and houses and caring for children.  Pretty riveting stuff
" I've always wondered if people actually talked at length about lawn maintenance or if it's just another 'this weather, huh?' Kinda thing"
" Like there's no way people get *that* into lawn care, right?"
 One of my coworkers legit started a sentence during lunch with 'so on Sunday I was thatching my lawn...'
 Wanted to be like 'that sounds awful'
 Lmao
 I guess it's like how we casually quote booyah
 Haha
 'so on Saturday I was single-man dping this hoe'
 What is thatching btw
 I imagine it's like putting up cover so your grass doesn't get too much sun
 But idk

 It's like removing the dead parts I think
 I think it's when you go through with a stiff rake and remove dead roots

 And then you hang yourself in the garage

" You know, just a nice little Sunday"
 It's pretty sad that lawn care actually dominates the majority of weekends in suburban life

 Yeah what a waste of time and energy
 But I can't imagine if you make decent money and buy something within your means it would be that expensive to pay someone to do it
 It really sounds that way. Why spend a significant portion of your life doing something you hate that also doesn't make you money
 Maybe
 If your yard is smallish
 If you don't care about perfectly manicured lawns you can always get the neighbor kid to mow that fucker for pennies on the dollar
 Yeah
 The back yard at Courtney's dads house is pretty cool.  I think it's technically mowed but it's basically moss and natural forest ground.  No fertilizing or watering needed
 That's legit
 Just let nature do her thang
 I think that's how a lot of American lawns were at one point
 Scott's or some similar company paid publicists to shame ppl who had multiple natural types of ground cover
" My dad likes mowing the lawn, but I suspect it's so he can put on the sweet ear muffs I bought him and not have to listen to my mom."

 But that's really epic that a teacher from the ol Brass city won the national award.
 Looks like Waterbury's really becoming quite the place complete with a national teacher of the year and on top of that the timex museum and Jesus land. Woo

" Imagine living life in such a delusional state that you sincerely believed stuff like that to be true.  It kind of makes me slightly sympathetic of the crazy conservative people... Like if I really believed that I would be freaking out too.  I reminds me of when I took CS math and we were studying formal logic and my prof was saying that politics is basically all about just making logical fallacies.  Where you basically promote conclusions that are valid based on a set of premises, but usually people don't question the validity of the premises themselves, or it's difficult to do so."
 That's like the bedrock of religion too.

 Shit is crazy.  Boston is slowly catching up too.  Time to move to Detroit
 Yessh
" Sadly Detroit of all places is trending towards gentrification. You can still get some super nice Victorian houses on the cheap, but it probably won't last. The city is being lubed with artists right now. Just waiting for some high paying industries and their yuppie workforce to plunge in balls deep off a step ladder."
 The wheels on the bus go round and round
 I guess in the meantime you could open a bakery there. Capitalize on the gritty beard and post-industrial city image. Keep it real by selling loafs for $10 a pop.
 Maybe include a cool background story about how you grew up on the mean streets of Detroit and made it out flipping ancient grain loafs.
 Lol
 This new Haven voting line is looking pretty intimidating
 Can't believe 08 election was 8 years ago.   Remember waiting in line outside EO smith
 Feeling like I shoulda just bought the fastpass
 Lol
 Damn that was a long time ago
 Haha
 Yeah man that was the first time we could vote
 Feels like another life
 Also I think that was the time I accidentally voted against same sex marriage in CT
 Lmao
 Really noobsauced on that one
 Same they made it hella confusing
 Those lobbyists outside the voting area were pretty sneaky iirc
 Mass might pass recreational Maryjane.  Maybe I'll diversify into artisan hydro dank

 Yup
 Does ct have any election day bills? I didn't see any online
 Bills?
 No ballot measures for CT according to the Google
 I guess bills is the wrong word. Ballot issues I guess? Like the same sex marriage thing
 Oh that lol
" Yeah I was surprised, I thought I missed something"
 I guess I'll know for sure in an hour or two
 I forgot I'm still registered in Storrs.
 You should check online tbh
 They don't have any info on me
 I'm just reregistering on the spot
 Better trek your ass on down to EO smith then
 Maybe grab a froyo at Storrs downtown afterward
 http://www.dir.ct.gov/sots/LookUp.aspx
 That would tell you if you have any registration info in ct
 Guess I'm not registered in Storrs
 Not sure where actually.
 Dat robust DMV database
 Would love to see what kind of set up they have under the hood.  Gotta be a total nightmare.  Probably one copy of an MS access database on a single machine from 1995
 I worked with DMV data during my masters
 It's still in punchcard format
 No way
 State of the art tech in the mid 20th century
 It did have characters as opposed to punching (maybe it's called something different) but it was an A-Z+0-9 thing with a 40 character limit per line
 Wow...
 I do believe that is the format of one of the 'newer' punchcsrds
 Tax dollars hard at work
 Make the DMV great again
 I think the scariest thing coming out of this election is the rise of misguided and illogical populist thought.

 Same thing here
 Just crazy how wrong the polls and predictions were.  Most people never even considered this was an actual possibility.  I can't even process it
 Aggregated polls had Hillary at 93% win chance less than a week out.  About the same with prediction markets.  It was at around 83% at 8pm last night
 Well never underestimate the discontent masses. We are fortunate enough to belong to the more privileged segment of the US population.
 I read an article by a guy who was slamming the fivethirtyeight model because it predicted a 35% chance of trump winning
 He was not a good statistician but he basically was confused as to why that probablility was so high while huffpost and ny times and other left leaning models had a 99% chance of Hillary winning
 I guess Nate silver still knows his shit
 Yeah
" Yeah, he was very cautious all the way."
 That seems to be the takeaway is that she really failed to court the blue collar workers which dems historically won.   Basically their frustration outweighed their reservations about trump's bigotry
 Bernie would have done better in that demographic
 Absolutely
 <Media omitted>
 Yep and back with Obama he had Biden to attract blue collars
 Lol
 I don't think all of them could possibly be that ignorant and hateful.  But when you gotta put food on the table that forces you to make certain choices.  Le sigh 😞
 I think it's our thinking from a rural perspective
 Good thing is we live in a country where we vote and choose someone and that's it.
" Nobody has given a shit about people outside cities, most of all hillary"
 There's not post election brawl.... Factions literally shooting each other
 Trump won't help them but he will hurt urban areas for sure
" Agreed, I saw this report on rural healthcare last week and I really began to understand why there are so many people angry enough to vote for trump https://youtu.be/LzPCEgc7s_s"
 Yeah... Silver lining is this is going to force both parties to really reevaluate shit and hopefully we'll get much better candidates next time around
 He's like the Martin shkreli of politics
 Hopefully pisses enough people off to make a change
 Hopefully.
" And if Trump tweets us into nuclear war, the ensuring nuclear winter will not only halt global warming but will also reduce the population problem. Always look on the bright side"

 Well at least gay marriage was already legalized so that can't get taken away.  Feel really bad for Courtney though bc she works in reproductive health and her whole company could basically get defunded
 Just feel bad for women in general
 I thought trump also promised he would try to repeal same sex marriage
 Seriously though womens rights are going to be set back another decade or teo
 Is that even repeal-able at this point?  I can't imagine he really opposes it. He's not religious
" I hope he doesn't roll back progressive gains, we'd be back to 1900."
 I doubt you can repeal. It's already been supported by the supreme Court
 Kinda assumed that stance was just to get votes
 I feel like we need to bubble wrap Ruth bader Ginsburg and assign a doctor to check on her daily. Same for the other old liberal leaning judges
 We could easily slide back if the supreme Court gets stacked with old Republican guys
" If I remember from civics, the only way to override that is to shift the foundation of the supreme Court by pushing a constitutional amendment through."
 I think I'm gonna donate whatever proceeds I get from trump tax cuts to women's health and/or NAACP.
 Assuming we get tax cuts.  We'd better at least get that in exchange for having to endure this imbecile for 4 years
 Woof
 Yeah
 Not a bad idea

 Did you guys happen to hear about that kid who got arrested for grabbing a girl's ass at UConn?
 They got surveillance footage of him running away after he did it and they sent out still frames of him to the entire campus. He was found and arrested in like an hour
" And then the next day, a guy guilty of the exact same thing became president"
 What an amazing time
 That kid's probably gonna be a registered sex offender for life. Definitely not holding any public office.
 And the guy who got elected actually went one further and 'grabbed em by the pussy'.  That guy will sit in the Oval Office.
 That was a legit article Sean. Seems like that's the consensus on why we have a literal crazy person as a president-elect
 Also I'm torn about the guy who grabbed the girls ass. Was it particularly heinous?
 I've had my ass grabbed on numerous occasions at UConn. I totally understand getting rid of shit like this but I do wonder about how prevalent it seemed to be when we were undergrads
" Yeah... I'm definitely guilty of a few ass grabs back in the day, specifically admist spring weekend mobs"
" I think the social climate right now is hypersensitive about this stuff because people are fed up with men getting away with harassing/assaulting women.  Which is understandable.  But obviously it's not black and white, there is a huge difference between grabbing someone's butt and raping someone.  So yeah I'd hope this guys life doesn't get ruined by it, but also important to recognize the behavior is wrong and call people out for it"
 I'm totally with you on needing to make a cultural change on this front. It just worries me that so many people are going to ignore the nuances to these issues in light of trump being elected
 I've seen/heard more hate speech in the past 36 hours than ive heard in the last year combined
 Yeah I know.  Even oppressed people can succumb to mob mentality
" Most of it has come from Aru and her friends, and from liberal media outlets"
 I worry that it's going to become very draconian as opposed to being understanding
 It can definitely lead to some serious conflicts
 Looks like we're in for a wild ride these next few years
 Yeah definitely not condoning any form of sexual assault. The issue shouldn't be black and white but accessing nuances takes time and resources.
" I think the problem here and around the world is that human labor intensive industry has come and gone at a rate that far outstrips the life span of the existing labor pool. Basically we are left with a large number of people but no jobs. When you boil down all the racism, religious fanaticism, and other forms of hate; it comes down to the human struggle of finding basic resources food, shelter, water, energy source, and something to occupy/placate the human mind (pursuit of happiness). Most people either lack these things completely or have a bare minimum but no guarantee of a regular supply. I still believe if we as humanity can solidify this supply of basic needs and guarantee equal availability to every human, the majority of the humanities problems will be an after thought with a few generations. Automation also makes this much easier to accomplish. Of course, this probably will have to be done asking with some considerably less palatable things like secular education and a sustained level of birth control (active or passive methods)"
 Sounds like communism but it can more like be placed within the constructs of a Western democracy and accomplished through private industry. Fully automating the supply of such resources also addresses the contentious issue of who laborers while others benefit.
 Just the musings of an office drone.
" Yeah I think the whole free trade and automation thing is similar to the problem of gentrification.  You have these unstoppable forces that are irreversible and technically beneficial for the greater society in the long run but in the process some people get fucked over.  So the question is how do you deal with that?  Libertarian view is 'too bad, adapt or die'.  The opposite extreme is to be Luddites and prevent any change or progress altogether.  Neither really seems like a good strategy"
 It's a matter of how free trade and automation are used. Do you choose to concentrate the gains in the hands of a few and perpetuate the historical inequalities? Or do you use the current unprecedented global connectivity and ability to separate humans from labor to proliferate something that benefits everyone? Unfortunately humans are selfish and short sighted. The libertarian and Luddite views are just different sides on the same selfish coin.
" Allow either to run their way and, well, you have where we are today."
 I think you guys would appreciate player piano
" Pretty solid novel, but it definitely takes an anti automation view"

 Btw is the majority of the increase tied to property value increase nearby or is it more a result of your renovations?
 Can't wait to find out what 'great' means. Think I might look for great with a house in the wooded mountains.
 Best get solar panels while they're competitive against big oil
 That keystone XXL is gonna lay some serious pipe
 It's related to the nearby sales. I'm pretty sure the city has no idea what type of reno has happened
 At least trump will probably cut your taxes
 Damn that's popping off
 Do you have an estate tax on that house? Doubt it's worth enough for it but it could be getting close
 Otherwise you're shit out of luck
 Lol love how the keystone is that xxl pipe
 Estate tax? Isn't that a post grey veil tax on your inheritors?
 Oh maybe
" Also I don't think trump will cut the local property tax. It's pretty low as it stands. They really don't need to up taxes when property prices are already wiggity wiggity whack. And as soon as the union sq and expanded assembly housing developments come into play, it's gonna be an ass so tight it won't even let your nuts out situation."
 I thought it might have to do with more pricey homes but u think you're right
 Income tax and estate seems to be where he is concentrating his cuts

" Also found out the day after the Costco Christmas party there's always awkward sales of plan b at the pharmacy, hopefully I'm not working that day."
" Oh, to be young and employed by a major wholesale chain"
 Oh also supposedly plan b is over the counter in NY state. No idea how that works but I saw them next to the rest of the 'family planning' items at one of the CVS's down there
" Wow, I guess that makes it's a hell of a lot easier to buy plan b with Martinelli's apple juice."

 Cooked.  I bake them to about 95% done then let cool and freeze in air tight plastic.  Then when you wanna eat just thaw and pop in oven for 5-10 min.  works really well
 Nice. Sounds like that could easily work as a retail method. Sneak a loaf any goddamn time of the day.
" That's exactly what this breakfast place called Toast near UConn does. Great bread there and I thought that they must bake it themselves, but it turns out they order it frozen like that and just cook it the last bit of the way."
 Haha. I guess they live up to their name. Also Toast sounds like a hipster breakfast place.

 Man those hands and feet creep me the hell out
 This guy really knows how to bring the weird
" If I ever have kids, I'm gonna tell them every Christmas Santa squats over the chimney and magically pinches off gifts... Should make for some good parent teacher meetings."
 Santa did a stint in prison. Perfected the art of keister storage.

 Haha I'm a Steve.
 I used to be a Steve.  Now I love Fridays 😁
" Go ride your hamster wheel, Linda!"
" But yeah after working in an office.... Friday's actually mean something. No doubt it's a social construct, but we're stuck in the machine whether we like it or not. And not running the wheel for two days is pretty sweet. So yep I am excited for Friday."
 So Uncle Steve is a real piece of shit.
" Speaking of hamster wheels, I had an interview on Wednesday at the Army Research Lab. I'm actually pretty excited about potentially working there. The funny thing was that the head of the branch that I was interviewing at is named Cindy. And people kept saying things like, 'oh we'll just run that by Cindy'. And all I could think of was Cindy Burns from Jim's 15 min avant garde vox recording."
 Hahaha good ol Cindy Byrne
 That's awesome though.  Just don't let them trick you into making bombs
" I'd be a civilian contractor in a group working on basic science for fuel cells and batteries. It turns out that efficient energy technologies are good for combat because they're silent and can potentially be easier to transport. So even climate-change-denying Trump will effectively be funding research to fight climate change by funding the department of defense. That said, other groups at the lab work on some pretty deadly sheeuuutt."
 Toyota Priuses are great for drive bys.
 But that's awesome if you can land a job with army research. Probably get a pretty sweet benefits package from the gov.
 Prius Ref. from Weeds
 Haha silent but deadly

" Damn Alex, that sounds like pretty exciting work"

 Yeah this is a thing. Read about it in the Atlantic and had to check it out. It's from Japan. I guess it's a tedium/patience hobby like ship in a bottle.
 Japanese people still bringing the weird hard as ever

 We should make a word cloud of our WhatsApp chat
