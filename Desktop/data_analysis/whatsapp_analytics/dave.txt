 Haha nice
 So many commercials on tv for website building and marketing services. But the real question is can their CEO freestyle in a Scottish accent?
 That'll be the deal breaker question in rfp's for web designers. 'Oh you can't spit bars over this beat...gtfo.'
 Spent what seemed like hours going through sas files and taking notes..... Then I woke up. Worst type of dream.
 And then the case I helped carefully assemble...A group of auditors just ran a three p train on it.
" Their team was methodical. Though they gave weak responses to some counters, they were in the position of power and they def flipped the dick down. Wouldn't have been surprise if I heard a bunch of hype men in the background of the conference call."
 Made me remember... In life you're either getting fucked in the ass or fucking people in the ass. Choose a position..... I might make my next job with the government regulators
 Yeah rolling up in places and screaming 'prepare to be fucked by the long dick of the law.' I need to get in on this consultant/regulatory train.
 So for labor day what foods should we bring? I still got that turkey in deep freeze and can always murk Meatman for more variety.
 Sea dogs anyone?
 Pretty sure showing up with a keg of sea dog would earn me a permanent ban from Alex's place. Though it would beg the question who would ever drink that much sea dog to warrant retailing of bulk quantities.
 Wait. Probably the girls impressed with my purchase of the sampler.
 Yeah a hiking snack besides almonds would be good. Would the turkey be doable?
 Yep I'll start that tonight. Or me and Jim can do fast faucet thingamajig defrost like our previous turkey cooking adventures.
 Aw sheeeit... We're gonna get so weird.
 That picture lol. Had to mute the phone to laugh during a doctor call.
 Should be I've checked and its did for 9 months to a year
 Hey we could always pull a bear grylls on a hike
 I'll bring some backup meat just in case the turkey turns into Shaq attacks on the backboard.
 November....
 Frozen always
 These were from the Thanksgiving season. They were a special batch for employees.

 Damn that's a lot of anal prn
 2.5 hour round trip sounds good. Not 3 hours one way.
 This will be nice for my hiking resume.
" Sorry xzibit, but i already shut down the okc profile."
" Nothing like having a meeting with the operations manager and he opens with 'We got a big piece of shit and it's about to hit but the fan, and there's gonna be shit everywhere.'"
 It was funny until we reviewed all the current anal prolapsing issues plaguing our office.
 How are we all getting up to Vermont? Any carpooling or pick ups from the bus station?
 I have work until 6 tomorrow. Might lug the turkey to work and and stash it in the fridge.
 Then make a straight shot up 91 for an ETA of 2100
 Jim dunno if you wanna carpool?
 I'll be in Wallingford so a quick hop on 15
 I'll drive down to New Haven. Should get there just about the same time you get out of work.
 Gotta shit on the floor
" Rick and Morty, dude. Watch it. It'll change your life."
 So on top of the turkey I'm bringing some back ribs. Anyone gonna handle the vegetable department. Really want nothing but net all weekend.
 <Media omitted>
 Yeah I'd be down for some boners too.
 And bring your homebrew empties
" Butze, this is why we can't have nice things... Jk, I'll just pick up extra bottles for the next bottle session."
 Looks like the end of this weekend will be like trying to duck a beach ball through a basketball hoop.

" Just found out my company fucked up. My health insurance doesn't kick in until next week, so I've been without coverage for a while now. Really killing it in Roy II."
 Sigh.... The customer service reps have been really fucking up. Now I notice one of them uses comic sans with multicolor font for an email signature..... Not sure of I can take them seriously
 Yeah that guy is braving the heat and the stares.
 <Media omitted>
 That along with the family portrait and little dilapidated home details
 Email for credit limit increase and then one from my 401k plan saying I have good diversification. Is this supposed to be the RL equivalent of the video game achievement pop ups. Because they feel equally empty.
 The video icon already says a lot. White dude with bleach blonde hair.... This will be interesting.
 Valn√∏tt pedal
 Got some long stubble going... If I keep this to the end of the week I'll have a basic beard.
 To shave or not to shave...
" Lmao, that's a gnarly beard though."
" Lol yeah, so deep."
 Haha nice
 And yeah klunge. That British vernacular.
" Lol I don't remember that article, but it sounds interesting"
" And I scrolled past pencil mustache pizza man, I could hear the words 'it'sa tight butthole'"
 As i*
" Speaking of not giving a fuck, I've decided to go full retard with growing a beard."

 I'm not sure what's worse: the fact that he's ordained clergy now or the discussion you two had as seventh graders.
 The sound of butt stuff is also stuck in my head.
" Those were the early days of the internet, too. Don't think any streaming sites existed yet. Or if they did it was pixel porn. He'd have that stuff on hard copy DVD/vhs."
" Yeah way before HD, way before 16:9 standard. Those clicky clack days of porn."
 http://www.vice.com/read/undergrads-today-are-the-worst-a-tas-confession?utm_source=vicefbus
 Parts if this article made me think of your TA stories and the sordid state of higher ed.
 Just imagining you guys on your knees with arms to the heavens bellowing out 'How do I reach these kids?'
 Or Alex proctoring an exam and answer questions with a simple 'fuck should I know'
 Machine shop again?
 Or I mean the laser metal lab
 This is awesome.
" Damn, I had conversation with my mom about my time at UConn. And I remembered how much I fucking hated that place. Like coming out of North garage in the morning and feeling like I stepped in a streaming pile of shit. Or crossing streets with no fucks given while staring down bro drivers and occasionally whispering 'do it ya mother fucker.'"
 That's also why I find it particularly funny when Rick throws out the taunt in near death situations.
 Lol.
" People always repeat the 'college is the best time of your life' or 'I'd doing anything to relive college' mantras. I say bull shit.  I'm much happier in the workforce. Sure, I met great people and had some important life lessons. But overall college is a really disturbing 4 (7 in my case) year carnival/microcosm that I don't need to experience again. Had my fill."
 Now I'm thinking... if I'm ever a parent how'd I justify sending a barely mature adult to such a place and paying 30-60k per year.
" When I'm 90, I'm gonna be going 90"
" Jim, I feel like that could make a good motivational poster."
 Chipotle in Hamden. All the patrons are prissy white girls and soccer mom's with kids rolling with luxury cars. Then the workers all come in city bus and look haggardly.... Tale off two cities.
 Get ready to be bummed out
" Also, I wish there was a one of the phone 'helpers' like siri or cortana but with the Mr. Meeseeks voice."
 Gotta keep it real
" Ah, classic delegating... Keeps the world a turning."
" On a side note, my mom told me I really needed to shave this morning. Asked me how I'm supposed to find a girl while rocking facial scruff....."
 For some reason I'm hearing that delivered in the tone and voice of the apple jacks kids.
 Can't wait for the returns on the beard I'm growing. Especially since I'll be Asian with a beard. That's like a Articuno status.
 I've looked at this photo five times and I laugh uncontrollably each time. Bathroom humor just never gets old.
 It looks like Pooh has fallen on some hard times... Waking up face down in a sewage drain. Must've happened when Christopher Robin got older and interests changed to 'wanking.'
 Like a depressing version of Toy Story.
 Oh right...forgot about that one and it's depressing plot.
 Its*
 Lmao
 Holy shit. The CERN folk are the edge.
 Riding chillwaves while unraveling the mysteries of the universe..... So next level auth.
 The name Carles Sagan popped in my head.
 Oh snap I forgot there was a new Rick and Morty last night
 Caught an episode of bear grylls on BBC. Happened to be the one where he floats off into the sunset with an enema.
 'Just lie back and think of...ugghh... England'
 All I could think of was Bill Burrs stand-up but on Bostonian vernacular.
 Damn almost everyone in the office is happily heading off to the employee appreciation river cruise. Me... I'm still sitting here buried in a heap of work. But I remember: at least I'm not getting interrupted with questions about lube and plan b. I smile to myself. I guess this is better than the carpet store.
 They really cranked up the realism in Roy II.
 <Media omitted>
 It's from the fart saving carpet store mother fucker episode. They mention Roy 2 in the post credit blips and chitz commercial.
 Speaking of Rick and Morty. The Post Rock girl had that in her profile favorites. Mentioned it in my opening message.... Ooooo weeee
 Listening to hybrid theory at work. So many feels. So long ago.
 Btw Sean if you're getting a suv with a different personal brand. You could look into the Toyota FJ. The car screams 'I am outdoor adventure bro.' Combo that with a pair of Oakley's and you'll probably give of the impression that you crush light beer on the reg.
 Yeah the vehicle caters to a special group of people. Like if you want give of an obnoxious poo brain vibe.
" Kids will state at you and the car. And parents will tell them it's not nice to stare, that man obviously has poo brain."
 Stare*
 Ooooo weeeee.... Gotta throw some 22's on it now.
 You could also be the person that brings whistle tips to the east coast.
" Mention to my parents that I'm thinking about getting a bike. Basically gets called a dumb idea, gonna get hit by a car, robbed on a trail, etc. Then my dad tells me to learn dancing....WTF is this, some weird reverse footloose shit."
" Oh shit dude, I just noticed your Amazon message. Congrats dude. That's some good stuff."
" Now if the hiring manager makes you watch them jerk off, you can just pull out the Amazon letter."
 Haha. I'm imagining the whole jacking off thing would be covered in the job hunt book: Chapter 17 Negotiation Tactics - Appropriate times to start wanking during an interview and establishing authority by carefully choosing where to nut
 Almost wrecked my car this morning dodging some loose carpet rolls lying in the road.... fucking carpet rolls.
 Yeah because girls know they're holding all the cards.
" There's no shortage of dicks, but girls are limited and in high demand"
 Lol. PC Jim
 Yeah I should've clarified my initial statement. Girls are holding all the cards on okc. Okc interface doesn't have a send picture option. Need to get the digits before you can start sending dick Rembrandts.
 Ah yes vivid description. Much like the legendary blood ninja.

 üöπüêéüòµ
" Nice, just got told by a member to go have a stroke. Should have responded with no I'm probably gonna meet my demise in some carpet related accident."
 Member of one of the pharmacy benefit plans
 Kinda had to lay down some bad news on the member
 Had to deny a needa need for a stroke patient. But the wasn't related to testing the stroke itself. More like the patient had some nerve issues post stroke. The need could possible be used for those nerve problems but in accordance to gov regs there's not enough support. So I had to deny.
" Insurance is not making people eat alpo, but more like preventing people from frivolously using meds (especially expensive shit) and making everyone else attached to the plan eat alpo."
" Jeez, Morty, you got what the intergalactic call a very planetary mindset."
 Had a discussion about how the office would go about letting someone go and the upcoming security preparations. Assessing the risk that said employee would go postal.
 Hope y'all say some ridiculous shit on the 6 o'clock news. Like 'Dave... He had a big heart and really cared about people. But boy was he a chronic masturbator and into that strokey chokey shit'
" Nice. And there's a built in rack that says 'bitch, I do outdoors activities.'"
" You should put rack your bike on the back, attach a kayak to the roof, and slap a couple 26.2 and eat green/organic stickers on the truck."
 Then cruise around Cambridge playing folksy indie music to pick up baguettes
 What about mud flaps with that girl silhouette
 'She looked like the girl on the mud flaps' -Jimmy
" If you go trucknutz and mudflaps, you'd definitely need the Monster energy sticker. Maybe toss in the fox racing for good measure. But that's a whole different set of girls. Like girls that shot guns and maybe went to community college."
 Ah painting with broad strokes
 The Sneaky Butcher Shop.
 And that's the way the news goes
 They'd probably be calling you 'sprinkles.'
 Oh yeah... That
 Then again that whole perspective thing... Maybe they referred to us as the weird too.
 Remember we were so cool back in those days.
" Ah right, so many memories I've left in some dusty recess of my mind."

" Oh man, I listened to the com truise remix to a tron soundtrack song. Made me remember the time I played it for some of y'all on a car ride back from buckland hills. There were virgin ear canals that couldn't handle the auditory penetration."
" Happy birthday, Alex!!! 28 damn."
" Well now that you own a snake, I don't need to hold back when I visit your place."
 Porcelain war crimes
 Haha. You could've also tried in some liqid plumber double penetration before investing in hardware.
" And Sean, my beard mentor, said I should post this to the chat. Advice on trimming?"

" Sigh... The meeting I get left out of, there's free lunch and a bunch of hot vendors presenting. Meanwhile I'm holding down the daily work and eating the remnants from their breakfast."
 Well they're just gonna get the bare minimum from me today
 Wish one of y'all owned a dog (preferably a puppy). Need to up my tinder photo game.
 Or maybe a bunch of baby ducks
" At the shelter: 'Sir, You gonna adopt all these dogs' 'Nah, fuck that shit... just hurry up and take the photo for my tinder.'"
 Pretty store or a petting zoo woiuld be a good idea. Also what up with all the profiles with the 'better not be holding a fish' disclaimer
" And the girls with inspirational quotes in their description. For fucks sake, I'm not looking for office posters on tinder"
 Haha nice. They let you keep your old license? DMV took my old one when I renewed.
 I still try to tap B whenever the evolution alerts comes up in life.
 Kinda like pickachu refusing to evolve. But then Ash forces his way later in the show with a lightening stone suppository.
 Lol. That idiot degree... Money well spent.
 Also Jim thanks for the 5 min butt dial
 That moment when you realize you qualify for a 22 year old's 'looking for someone older' age range.
 Bitch lost her birth control. Bitch needs an override for lost birth control. Bitch says it's an emergency. Bitch needs to get creampied asap.

 Or do lines of collaxion crystal dust off a stripper's ass.
 She must love to laugh.
 Sounds so laid back and down to earth.
 My mom tells the realtor I'd have a hard time kicking out the current tenants to increase rent because I have a soft heart.
 I could see Butze hanging that to by his bed.

 What happened to whole UConn is having budget issues thing?
 Good luck. That's how you should open up the interview too.
 An older dude just asked me what's the 'best way to remove hair from the genitals.' He brought his lady friend too.

" So today I had to google a letter format for some loan documents. Ended up finding info on a credit score forum. Normally, I see posts with flair like lists of prior phones on a smartphone group, computer specs for gaming, car upgrades, or other hobby/rl achievement stuff.

 Is that the thesis you wrote in 24 hours?

" Yeah dunno if you'd wanna be in East Somerville just yet. It's up and coming, as my realtor says, 'they still speak Portuguese in the area.' And I'm receiving the place with some tenants. My living space is the trap house basement."

" When I see Christmas lights strung up in the neighborhood, I don't think about Christmas hogwash. Rather, I remember the time we spelled Prudence with lights and we were the cool kids... Good times."

 Lol. No Christmas lights for the place. It's an ugly rear unit building. Strictly clear heels updates.

" Alex, how did the fermentation bucket look. Any bubbling or warmth coming off the bucket? Maybe some bread smell."
 Hmm. There might be some growth lag time before the yeast population explodes and they start putting up condos in the bucket.

" Had to deny an infirmed priest's medication. The facility took a while to pull the guy out of bed and into a wheel chair just to receive my call. All the while i was left on hold with choir/Gregorian chant music. Unfortunately the priest was no longer coherent, so i hastily said my bit about denials and ended the call. A most awkward experience to say the least."
" Haven't seen breaking bad yet so Im not sure how the show plays out. Wasn't it all about meth, Miami and money."

 Yep turning down my other acceptances was definitely the most financially sound decision I've made.
 Tonight I went to the med school formal with the girl I'm dating. I learned that my feelings for this girl are indistinguishable from my feelings for the house I bought. I'm too cold and dead on the inside to bring myself to care about the girls I meet. But I wear a solid good mask.
" Thanks for the support. Things have just been really stressful lately, which pulls me to a point where I just avoid emotions. That combined with social anxiety at the formal and being confused by the how carefree her peers seemed basically put me over the edge."
" I'm feeling a bit better now. Although, I'm pretty sure I've been making a poor effort at showing her any affection. And I was particularly detached/sullen Saturday night. We haven't talked since and I'm guessing she's disappointed."
" I''ve been thinking about going the honesty route. Although, I just got a splits text. So, I don't know."
" The 'too busy for a relationship, etc.' Though I know it's because of my emotional unavailability."
" When you spend over two decades learning to remove emotions and building around learning disorders, this is what happens. Works for my job, but completely detrimental for my social life."
" As we change topics, just want to say thanks y'all for being supportive. I'm think I've put this whole fiasco behind me and it's probably best that it's over. Lotta lessons learned and things to fix."

 OK Google searched. never knew the covers were called gaskets.

 It's pretty mind boggling how many dating profiles sound the same. 'Love to laugh' ect.  Starting to wonder is there a template for their profiles or is there just a horde of cookie cutter basic girls?
 But that would still mean the vast majority of girls still think similarly. Maybe everyone strives toward creating a benign sounding profile that shit just converges toward the same phrases and diction.

 Oooo weeee
 per usual I'll be showing up with a bulge of meats
 trying to find a fresh choked heirloom pig from a local farm
" We do need a pig, right? I'm assuming a suckling pig should have a large enough cavity for a pineapple."
 Well looks like the Berkshire strain of baby pigs are not available at the nearby farm. Only got some lean strain piglets. Good news for them because I won't have to make eye with their eater.
 But I can still pick up some OG strain back ribs and loin chops from local meat dealer.
 haha

 They've improved the place so much that I might be fooled into sending my spawn there in the future.
 Having an existential crisis. Who wants pheasant and rack of lamb along with OG oinks?
 I'm buying meat because of said crisis. Sometimes life makes you want to you buy a serious meat spread. Because life.
 A family friend was recently murdered. So I've been lost in thoughts about the Sisyphean struggle of life. I'm glad we're all still alive.
 Ah sorry for dropping a real bummer into the chat. But definitely looking forward to this weekend and some good times.
" Current my meat list: 2 Berkshire pig back rib racks, 2 pheasants (maybe 3, they're smallish birds), large slab of Berkshire pork butt. May end up be subbing with Angus/dry aged steaks or fresh chickens or whatever distracts me at the meatman shop"
 good idea it'll be like dunking a beach ball after these meals
 yep that's the plan... maybe pulled pork pizza
 yeah pheasant not to sure. might just opt for fresh chicken's
 2 of them and try different styles
 we're gonna need some high quality BBQ sauce. Dunno if I should pick up a Costco jug of sweet baby rays
 haha
 or if someone has some artisanal smash your grandma BBQ sauce

 Just a pic from the local farm. Unfortunately I didn't get to look the pig on the eyes. But it's one of these types of oinkers
 pretty sure if I got to know the pig personally... we'd be eating vegetables and I'd have a pet pig in my backyard.
 so Jim should head down to your place after work? ETA 530
" Jim, how are we doing this carpool thing....Need to know... like Marc Anthony"

" Gotta make it cash only.  Maybe entirely internet based bread order/delivery.  Forgo store front, so you can avoid paying for desirable location."
 Wow. Shipping costs must be high. Bread has extremely low shelf life.
" Never tried it, but I wonder if vacuum bagging bread increases shelf life"
 Then again it's a moisture issue. Maybe plan and freeze months of 80% cooked loafs. Then finish them before each shipment. It's 'fresh'
 http://qz.com/571151/the-mast-brothers-fooled-the-world-into-buying-crappy-hipster-chocolate-for-10-a-bar/
 Just remember that thick beard of yours helps cover up artisanal corner cuts.
" Hmm...I guess you could sell frozen half baked loafs with cooking instructions. Then the buyer just needs to complete the baking process for fresh homemade artisan bread. It'll be like is that delivery or Digiorno? Nah, the Sneaky Baker be giving your wife baguettes and boules while you're at work."
 Ain't nothing sketchy about compromising your art so you can improve the reliability of your supply and make mo money.
 It would be difficult to find the right point to stop baking and flash freeze. Like a sweet spot that preserves moisture and structure.
 There can only be one...

 Someone at the office just used the words thirsty Thursday in a professional email.... Wtf
" Was thinking isn't the concern of music artists not being paid enough related to supply and demand. Recording equipment and computer software is so accessible that countless bedroom musicians have sprung up. The market is overwhelmingly flooded with producers and there products. Also there are a multitude of distribution methods (traditional physical copies, YouTube, SoundCloud, Bandcamp, torrent sites, Spotify). When supply is tipped to such extreme, prices would approach zero. Just find the situation to be basically individuals refusing to adapt to the changing market and acknowledge the game done changed."
" So music track themselves really are worth $0.0001a play or approaching free via pirating. And the artist doesn't make tracks to profit directly. But instead creates tracks/songs to grow their brand, which is then leveraged for profit via shows, endorsements, etc."
" Just my musings with caffeine coursing through me. Maybe, Sean, as a someone with commercial releases and interactions with smaller artists could provide an opinion."
 Yeah really digging it too. Really tickles the brain balls.

 Artisanal oatmeal.....
" Yeah I gotta admit I'm intrigued. Some of the flavor blends sound dope. Though the health conscious part is a bit false, most of the options will probably be loaded with fat and sugar unless you get stock oatmeal."
 But you gotta give the people what they want. Like that UConn student union salad place that masqueraded as a healthy option. Or people just assumed plants equates healthy even if it's floating in a bucket of ranch dressing.
 Some form of porridge is big in every culture. But I think we shy away from it nowadays because of modern package breakfast foods. It would be cool if someone opened a multi ethnic porridge shop.
 Hey Sean amongst your tech coworkers how many own condos in the Boston area? Or Alex dunno if you know if the majority of your sister's coworkers own in the Boston area?
 Reason I ask is because my street had a recent jump in sales with a bunch of places gutted and condo converted.
 Hmm... I'm trying to figure out who are the folks buying up multi family condo converts.
 May have to do the same on my place. Cash out while the economy is at peak before the cycle begins down swing/recession
 Yeah in planning on holding at least another 1.5 years. When the sales on my street and the neighboring streets go through I'll probably dump it.
 Then again o need to access how resilient prices in the area were during the last recession

 Not quite. There's a motor oil burn problem. It's kinda of a problem fit this generation of accord. And I'm out of the warranty years and mileage limit. So probably best to trade it in while there's still value and avoid potential engine repair work.

 Haha ass gaskets.
 But yeah the piston ass gaskets are the origin of the problem. Plus my car is up for a new set of tires and there's also a defect causing premature rear break wear.  I just don't see this car being designed to hit 200k like the usual expectation of Hondas
" Yeah definitely car AIDS. Brakes are tolerable, but the engine bit is unacceptable. There's been a lawsuits over the issue already. Don't really got that kind of time to take the car to the dealer for major servicing and possibly forking out serious dosh for a bandaid solution."
" Btw, Sean when you got your rav4 in MA, did you pay the sales tax and excise tax in the same year?"
" Ah. And from what I'm reading excise tax is used in lieu of individual town prop tax like in CT but fixed to a 2.5% rate, right?"
 Hmm there's much to weigh... Wish I lived in the city and could get rid of the car.

" I think the problem here and around the world is that human labor intensive industry has come and gone at a rate that far outstrips the life span of the existing labor pool. Basically we are left with a large number of people but no jobs. When you boil down all the racism, religious fanaticism, and other forms of hate; it comes down to the human struggle of finding basic resources food, shelter, water, energy source, and something to occupy/placate the human mind (pursuit of happiness). Most people either lack these things completely or have a bare minimum but no guarantee of a regular supply. I still believe if we as humanity can solidify this supply of basic needs and guarantee equal availability to every human, the majority of the humanities problems will be an after thought with a few generations. Automation also makes this much easier to accomplish. Of course, this probably will have to be done asking with some considerably less palatable things like secular education and a sustained level of birth control (active or passive methods)"
 Sounds like communism but it can more like be placed within the constructs of a Western democracy and accomplished through private industry. Fully automating the supply of such resources also addresses the contentious issue of who laborers while others benefit.
 Just the musings of an office drone.
 It's a matter of how free trade and automation are used. Do you choose to concentrate the gains in the hands of a few and perpetuate the historical inequalities? Or do you use the current unprecedented global connectivity and ability to separate humans from labor to proliferate something that benefits everyone? Unfortunately humans are selfish and short sighted. The libertarian and Luddite views are just different sides on the same selfish coin.
" Allow either to run their way and, well, you have where we are today."
 Hmm I'll need to stop by the libs later and give this book a read.

" And yep I anticipate the Trump presidency to be more of a comedy gold mine than the Bush years. Unless shit really goes super far right, then ain't nothing funny."
 Dang I wanna move to Mr Rogers neighborhood.
 Though property prices in the Neighborhood of Make Believe must be off the chain there. Heard they extending the electric trolley line and driving the puppets into the real world.
 Btw Dave Chappelle on SNL last night was pretty dope. Opening monologue was some classic stand-up.
 Wtf lol
" Jesus, I guess the value of my house shot up according to the Somerville accessor. Bad news is my tax bill nearly doubled. Kinda glad my current set of tenants are moving out. The city is really forcing my hand to flip the dick down."
 I'm basics tied to a system of trickle down ass fuckery
 Basically*
" Shit's really off here, dunno when it's gonna break."
 Can't wait to find out what 'great' means. Think I might look for great with a house in the wooded mountains.
 It's related to the nearby sales. I'm pretty sure the city has no idea what type of reno has happened
 Lol love how the keystone is that xxl pipe
 Estate tax? Isn't that a post grey veil tax on your inheritors?
" Also I don't think trump will cut the local property tax. It's pretty low as it stands. They really don't need to up taxes when property prices are already wiggity wiggity whack. And as soon as the union sq and expanded assembly housing developments come into play, it's gonna be an ass so tight it won't even let your nuts out situation."
 But goddamn who the fuck can afford to live there.
 AIDS?
 Lol that south park ref
 <Media omitted>
" Eh, I guess it could be driving through the door instead of fumigating the garage."
" Well after reading the posts, Trump is the definition of a wild card. He is whatever people see they need."
 Even when his statements are outlandish and contradictory.

 Reading this MD statement about a patient who's tried every thing from Viagra to testosterone and shaft injections but just can't nut.... In the End starts playing in my head
 Do you still tip when cars drive themselves?
 Ah man that's a bummer... Oh look cheesy bread.
 Haha. This is awesome.
 Oh yeah this is my type of comedy.

" Just saw on the news the CT DOT is doing a $1.3 million traffic study on i95. Hope that isn't going on your plate, Jim."
 So basically it'll be your project in a few months if your coworker fucks up.
 Haha. At least you got those quality wacarnolds rib sandwich reports on lock and the company gots to come through you.
 Also hearing 'He's trying!'
" Crap, just drank a jar of cold brew concentrate thinking it was regular coffee, now my brain is gonna get all existential during the workday."

 Guess I would need to find a hobosexual lady friend.
 Yep minimal living is definitely better. Been helping my parents clean out their basement in CT and it's like how did we accumulate so much stuff.
 Sometimes you need a second laptops to help out with the wfh boredom
 More like I didn't put away the work comp after when.
 Lol add modern plumbing and I'd definitely live in a box.
 Wonder if Chappelle is gonna get back on the stand-up circuit. Seems like he's been reappearing in things

 Doing business while doing business
 And now it's time to self inject myself a flu shot yay
 Called IT. Guy is blasting Twista in the background throughout the entire conversation.
 Aw sheeeut. Time to put in a PTO day and call the Get Wet Girls.
" Well, if it's any encouragement, the Get Wet Girls ain't getting any younger... Meditate on that."
 Jk.... Don't meditate on that image...Good luck on the final stretch
 Some people at the office wanna play Christmas music for holiday spirit. Perhaps I should suggest some Dipset Christmas.
" Never avoid the office lottery pool. It's a waste of money, but there's always that super slim chance you'll be the last and only person working."

 This Thanksgiving I'm thankful for not being married with kids like most of the people on my Facebook news feed. And the ample opportunities for dicking around.
" Nah, I'm gonna be a cool dad."
 Cool dad vibing too hard and embarrassing his kids.
 Haha
" No politics at the table, but having a debate about raising kids in the social media world."
 Yum lol
 Nut nut nut nuts in da artisan loaf
" Ah, love how most of my family assumes I'm up to a whole lotta nothing because I live at home and my job seems to have little relation to my schooling. Flying under the radar... Just the way I like it."
" Guess everyone has the weekend free, so the entire neighborhood is buzzing with leaf blowers. I'm pretty sure I could record all the lawn care sounds throughout the year and release a drone album."
 Also reminds me of the don hertzfeldt film and the long ass leaf blower scene
 https://youtu.be/1IUX0Qy-IDM
 The pipe is leaking....
 Gazing upon the chaos of shoppers and goods piled high at the Costco.... Damn it feels good to live in a Western country...Or at least until we realized we've consumed beyond the point of no return.
 Yeah I could use some of that good ass French toast. At the local best buy... Fun
 Nice. Hopefully I don't get stuck on the hill again lol.
 Goddamn that's some heavy stuff like Sisyphus's boulder.

 Seeing the transient young professional population in Somerville always gives me that warm fuzzy feeling...like Daniel Plainview staring at derrick spewing flame and black crude.
" Ocean of renters, baguettes, and chill vibes."
" Alex, where is the defense going to be at tomorrow?"
 Ah sorry. Was originally planning on driving up this morning to attend. But I'm getting called into work early. Good luck with the defense.

 Going to a client party hosted by my realtor. Basically get to meet all different levels of folks involved in running a gentrification train on Somerville. The places you'll go... I'm not sure about them.
 Also fucking hate social functions.
 I told her I was against gentrification and all about social justice.... But shit I just wanna plow everything and salt the fields until the boulder rolls back
 cookbook worthy photo.
 Even worse hanging two lonely bananas on the hanging rack fully knowing it won't work after eating one.
" Walked into the office, hear a co-worker yell 'We setting ourselves up for suck, people!!' It's gonna be a great day."

 Is that blue placemat like your bread casting couch? Bringing in those fresh baguettes and spreading 'em.
 Nice. Wish I could bring some weird to the vanilla tree at the office.
 So any of y'all have office Christmas parties coming up?
 Learn things about your co-workers you wish you could unlearn.
 Same. Gotta smile and be pleasant to the people I regularly berate at the other office... Should be fun.
 Maybe you should leave James at home and let Jimmy go to the party.
" Also found out the day after the Costco Christmas party there's always awkward sales of plan b at the pharmacy, hopefully I'm not working that day."
" Wow, I guess that makes it's a hell of a lot easier to buy plan b with Martinelli's apple juice."
 I think Ludacris was on to something with the area code method.
 <Media omitted>
 Almost laughed in the phone when the pharmacy answered with 'You've reached ICP.'
 Unfortunately it was Institutional Care Pharmacy.
 I guess if you ever get bored of baking you could make a segue into serial killing √† la Jeffrey Dahmer.
" ...ah making things super grim.... But seriously, is the freezer for storing dough or cooked loafs?"
 Nice. Sounds like that could easily work as a retail method. Sneak a loaf any goddamn time of the day.
 Haha. I guess they live up to their name. Also Toast sounds like a hipster breakfast place.
 <Media omitted>
" If I ever have kids, I'm gonna tell them every Christmas Santa squats over the chimney and magically pinches off gifts... Should make for some good parent teacher meetings."
 Santa did a stint in prison. Perfected the art of keister storage.

 Haha I'm a Steve.
" Go ride your hamster wheel, Linda!"
" But yeah after working in an office.... Friday's actually mean something. No doubt it's a social construct, but we're stuck in the machine whether we like it or not. And not running the wheel for two days is pretty sweet. So yep I am excited for Friday."
 So Uncle Steve is a real piece of shit.
 Toyota Priuses are great for drive bys.
 But that's awesome if you can land a job with army research. Probably get a pretty sweet benefits package from the gov.

 Captain choke at the office party.... Memories
 Coke*.... Captain choke would be a bdsm name.
 I wish I went to a dinner party school.
 What did you learn this week?
 We were sooo cool!
 Shit all this reminiscing got me craving a blueberry pancake corn dog.
 Haha this is great
 Btw Mr robot on USA is a pretty good show. Y'all should check it out.

 Little bits......
 Yeah this is a thing. Read about it in the Atlantic and had to check it out. It's from Japan. I guess it's a tedium/patience hobby like ship in a bottle.
 That's one shifty looking mother fucker. Looks like a guy who would leave turds around the office.

 This idea just popped in my head.... Death metal band but all the growling lyrics are excerpts from tax law and bits of financial advice.
