 Your dress shoes
 And the pants look large too
 We don't have any more time :/
 We have an hour to get back and get ready
 It took an hour to get here
 I think it's the best I can do while spending a total of 20 minutes here
 Yeah that's fine
 Hey huns were on the way back
 If you have 10 minutes could you do me a huge favor and iron the blue pants and white shirt? It's okay if you can't
 I've already done that :) you're all set here for a shower and a change
 Aww sank ewe hunnies
 Surprise!
 Keep the iron board out just in case doe
 Duh I'm no chump
 I have the larger of my two white shirts here with me
 May want to use the better fitting one for the wedding
 Not sure
 I think we'll be in the area in about 12 minutes
 Don't know what that means for me/dropping off the other hotel guys
 Are saad and or Vaidu with you?
 NM I'm good I'll be back in a couple mins
 Found the gym. It's small but decent
 Also apparently the left vs right thing is pretty common
 Left vs right?
 Yeah the lady at the front desk pointed to the right and was lile
 The gym is over there to your left
 Lolol
 Sorry huns the butt stuff comment was calling me
 Lemme know when you are here
 I'm getting my hair done he's frying my hair
 I hear it crackle every so often
 Omg I hate my hair Iook like fucking shirley temple
 I've seen one wave. It's a fucking curl
 I have to remind myself it's not my day but gah
 No pictures ðŸ™…ðŸ½
 I look like shirley temple in drag
 ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©
 I can't deal with this
 I look so ugly now
 Awwwww
 I'm not gonna want to be in pics
 Baby
 I wanna pic of you
 I don't care what anyone else thinks
 <Media omitted>
 Awww I like the curly
 I don't
 So I got some foods at the hotel lobby
 It's not what  I asked for
 This guy is the worst
 I sat down and Sasha and his girl.. Companion(?) Joined me
 I'm freaking out inside
 I had a 45 minute lunch with them. It was weird
 The girl was nice but Sasha clearly wanted no part in it
 Aww
 You hang out with Emily yet
 No
 Not sure what she's doing, I let her know when I got here, said I was just gonna be eating lunch
 No word from her
 I feel like I'm going to cry
 My hair is a matted mess
 I look better now
 Hey were heading down
 Last chance, you need anything besides Band-Aids?
 <Media omitted>
 Nope
 That was a good potato quality pic
 I like it
 Action shot
 We're at the church
 Where are youu
 If you have not left can you grab some aspirin plzzz
 I yam upstairs
 Awaitin but take your time
 I'm back I'm back I'm out of my shower
 Yay come up to vaidu and Saads room
 Were heading over now
 Nuuuu
 Bring me my crossbody pls
 Did you leave already?
 If not can you bring my shoooes
 They have people doing construction at the front tslesl
 Desk
 I'm waiting in the spa lobby
 Heading out now
 Where should I meet you
 I'm still working :/
 I need probably another 15-20 minutea
 That's how long it'll take me to get home
 Okay
 Come here :)
 Just plan to finish up by then k?
 Will do
 <Media omitted>
 Is this what you see or did you not get everything
 That's what I see
 But I'm getting really weird and spotty service right now
 Hmm
 I still think we should both head to your place now
 It doesn't make sense for us to be in new haven for half a day right?
 Unless you really wanna do something around here like vino
 I just wanna see you ðŸ˜
 I could use a nap
 Okay, whatever you wanna do hunnies
 Just lemme know what that is
 I'm gonna shower real quick now, im all packed up
 Hmm come to NY if you're all packed and stuffs
 HIII
 Hii honeys
 I'm so tired dood
 What happened whyyyyy
 Were u up late studying up for interview?
 Lol no I finished studying stuff at like 930 and I wanted to get an early night
 But there was a fucking cricket that found its way into my room
 2 things I learned about crickets last nighy
 First thing is that cricket chirps are surprisingly hard to locate
 Second thing is they are fucking loud
 It was so strange too, like it would stop for 5-10 minutes and I was like 'oh maybe its done or found its way out of my room'
 Nope.
 Hahaha
 Did u catch it
 And is ur room clean now
 Where was it
 My room is still sorta messy but the noise pollution is down now
 I finally found it around midnight I think
 It was so small and insignificant looking that I wasn't sure if I got it at first
 Lolol ðŸ”ªðŸ”ª?
 More like ðŸ‘ŸðŸ‘Ÿ
 And do u know how it got in? What if u have a cricket infestation
 Is that a thing?
 Idk
 There are crickets outside almost every house
 But it might be worse than having a newborn
 When do u leave?
 Like 6 or 7 today I think
 We might wait a little longer to avoid traffic
 Baby I look hot tonight
 I'll send u pics when I have them
 Ooo plz plz
 <Media omitted>
 Aww you are so pretty honeys
 I want to nap again my period is taking so much out of me I feel bad. I'm just sitting here :/
 Awww Hunnies I hope you feel better soon
 Ugh I feel like crap
 How are you?
 Hi honeys I am sorry I've been so quiet this weekend
 I hope you had a good time at the wedding and I miss yous
 I'm still at Alex's but I finally got the WiFi onto my phone
 No worries I figured you'd be mia since you're in the middle of nowhere :)
 Just give me a call when u get home. I hope you had a good weekend and was able to get some work done
 Aww I like you. I have been, not as much as I wanted to, but some at least
 I maybe got 10-12 hours of stuff in between Saturday and now
 I'm working on stuff now actually, waiting for ribs to finish cooking
 I'm gonna head out after the ribs, probably around 6 or 7
 Oooh enjoy :)
 <Media omitted>
 Alex's mom took a picture of the finished produc

 Awww baaaby
 I miss you
 Also it snowed here
 Not a lot but the roads are ice
 WHAT? ITS COLD :(
 I have to leave in a half hr to go to the airport
 Hey Hunnie did you land?
 hi baby, are you leaving tomorrow am or tonight? i kinda wanna go to the gym tonight if thats okay (will be like at 8 or something)
 I was planning on leaving tmmr morning. I can leave tonight if you want tho
 You gonna go to the gym by you?
 well i dont have any of my crap with me
 so i want to gym
 but we also have to pick up your pants (i have the recipet)
 and i should go grocery shopping
 so maybe ill do that instead and you can meet me?
 or you can  meet me to pick up ur pants and head up, and then i can leave to get my stuff done?
 so we meet in the middle
 You should gym if you want to hunnoes
 I can grab gym stuff for you and meet you at the gym
 that way ur not rushing tomorrow am.
 Let me know when you're thinking about leaving work today then
 well, when does lululemon stay open?
 We can figure stuffs out
 Open till 8pm
 We can gym together maybe? And then food shoppin after
 hmm ok
 well i appreciate your offer babes. we can figure it out close to the acutal time mmmk?
 Idk just trying to think
 If gym at 630 that'd be enough time for me to run and grab my pants
 Otherwise I can grab them first
 i have the receipt tho, maybe if i take a pic and text it to you they will accept it?
 yeah that works babe
 Hmm I will keep that in mind too. Just let me know when you're like 30 minutes from leaving the office, we can do all these thangs one way or another
 okay  cool
 was your stomach hurting this am?
 I don think so
 mine is not happy right now. i just had a bowl of veggies on top of a homemade veggie patty, and am sippin on green juice w/ ginger
 Was urs?
 Awww
 yeah, like crazy.
 Damn
 Chicken?
 no, just veg
 No I mean you think it was the chicken?
 not necessarily
 prob the oil they used
 fried stuff usually gives me stomachache, as does most carbs/breads
 Aw I see I see
 We can eat better to night
 so beata is working w/ a job outplacement gorup which is part of her exit package and shes raving about it. says you should look into it
 called lee hect harrison
 i used them before and didnt really get much out of them, but shes getting a lot out of it so might be worth looking into if its not too expensive
 I'll look into it
 Also I drank coffee this morning and I didn't think I was buzzed but I got up to shower and my legs and arms are shaking like crazy
 I may have had a bit too much caffeine
 Omg
 Are u ok? Lol
 No idea babes
 I probably need to get rid of all this excess energy
 So
 Fun story
 There was a mouse in the pizza box
 I made a slightly unmanly sound when I was gathering some garbage together and a grey blur jumped out
 In hindsight it was kinda cute, if scraggly looking
 Just thought you might want to know and/or think about the type of mousetraps you want to order
 U let it go?!
 Baby I didn't know it was there
 Lolol
 It jumped out of the pizza box and ran like the dickens
 I will prime now mousetraps
 L.ao
 Lmao*
 It ran under the fridge but there's a good chance it's in the walls by npw
 Either way I can't get at it
 Which one should I get?
 I don't want to see the mouse
 Lol I dunno I was looking at the listings
 I remember having ones that were enclosed back in lprraone
 I already named him Hubert
 I don't wanna see Hubert die
 Probably not the best idea to name it of you're plan on killing
 You can get the humane ones if you want
 Not that there's really anywhere for a mouse to be released in manhattan
 The trash chute
 Well sure for a dead mouse
 Not a live one
 Oh by humane I meant nonlethal but yeah that too
 You can get the ones that use electric shocks to kill
 Your mouse is pretty small so I imagine that would work fine
 http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00448MUVG/ref=psd_mlt_bc_B00448MUVG I think this is the one we had at my last place. It worked decently if you got a few and placed them around
 Not sure if something else would be better
 Ordered
 I'm hungry again
 Blah
 I'm hungry too
 I got my resume critique back, they didn't really like mine either
 Said they didn't like the visual style and that I should focus more on achievements than tasks
 But they thought I had experience in IT/data and somehow I also have 7 years of experience
 that was my feedback
 to the T
 masters prob counts as experience
 Sounds like it
 I mean it was a free review
 I'm guessing they spend probably 1-2 minutes tops going over the resume
 Though maybe that's what makes the most sense
 Oh also they showed a file size comparison and it seems like my resume is a small file compared to others
 I don't know what that's supposed to imply tho if resumes are supposed to be 1 page
 yeah
 i didnt get that part either
 meh wahtever
 Lol pretty much my reaction too
 ugh baby im SO HUNGRY
 omg
 Me too
 want to grab dinnnner
 I was gonna make the rest of the chicken sausage but idk if I should cook now
 oh bc of mouse?
 Lol
 Yeh
 I tossed out the garbage but I still need to clean them dishes
 i guess noodles are our only option
 huh
 It really sounds like it
 lmao baby
 Before or after gym tho
 i cant argue with that logic
 i want to say before bc i feel like im going to pass out
 but i know we wont gym
 Lol probably not
 so i guess after and pray i dont pass out
 I can bring some almonds
 umm
 They are here
 some almonds wont hold me over
 Lol
 Did you eat lunch
 thats like thorwing a bucket of water in the dessert and thinking youve helped some
 yeah, but just a bowl of veggies and some juice
 I can bring 2 things of almonds?
 ðŸ˜¬
 i had veggies, green juice, and almond latte
 so prob around idk, 500 cals for lunch,  150 for snack, 50 for coffee?
 I ate some sausage and a couple eggs at like 11
 did u have anything else?
 ...some almonds
 jesus
 Hahaha
 Well and bread
 yeah im cranky
 With the eggsnsausage
 but whatever we have to gym so ill just be in a bad mood till after
 I'm hungry tired
 Hungsausted
 me too. and i have to grocery shop.
 why dont u cook up the rest of the sausage for yourself now
 i wont get to gym until like 6:30 at the earliest
 Where is the gym
 Near you or near me
 anywhere
 lets go near you
 Can you grab a snack now at all
 Also can you text me the receipt for my sweatpants?
 I'll try to go there first
 its ok, ill just have low cal count today
 If we're gonna get soups today you could try Amazon nowing some grocerys tomorroa
 idk
 ill figure it out
 OK just don't pass out hunnies
 amazon now isnt all that geat tbh
 saumil just eats processed crap
 so he likes it
 Lolz
 its not good for fresh veg
 He also is in love with getting things delivered to him
 Just thinking out loud though, thought it might help save an extra 30 minutes of post gym hunger
 meh
 im hungry and cant eat and have to work out instead
 makes me very cranky
 might as well not eat dinner
 whats the point
 30 mins isnt going to make or break me

 Maybe like a dark rum idk

 I'd watch that movie
 Ok I'm about to head upstairs
 Back home to slump on the couch lol
 Noice
 I'm bout to leave work
 Yeah.2 drinks in
 Woot
 This guy made EM STRONG
 Wooo
 so ive found a system that works
 1. get resume up to date and SHORT. i want to take another look at yours
 2. find recruter on companies you want to apply to on linkedin
 3. send them request to be friends
 3. once you send a request, send them a quick note telling them you want to chat about opportunites at their company
 (knowing they have an open rec you can fill)
 that's worked this am so far at one place
 im gonna try my hand to see if it works elsewhere too
 How are you chatting with them from work tho
 phone
 linked in app on personal phone
 just to set up time
 Seems risky man
 nah
 OK
 i actually sent all the emails this am from home
 before i went to work
 and the guy emailed me back this am
 so i just went to the bathroom and compiled a quick response
 Ook
 im not having conversations, just to set up some tme w/ them.
 and then i'll prob go to some coffeeshop here and call them on my phone when the meetin gis set up
 to chat
 but apparently this works
 You doing it today?
 tomorrow
 i want to send resume out to others and do the same thing tonight
 Word
 so tomorrow hopefully i can hear back
 Vaidu said your resume is good but too wordy. she also told me mine was too wordy.
 so who knows
 lol
 I dunno
 A lot of it is subjective
 I thibk
 yeah, but she makes good points
 bc you scan a resume. if its too wordy you cant easily scan
 so your stuff gets lost / you wont get picked up
 i should probably go back to my six hour meeting today D:
 so annoying.
 YAY ANOTHER COMPANY REACHRD OUT TO ME FROM MY INITIAL EMAIL
 SYSTEM.WORKS
 (Email was two weeks ago so system is slightly flawed)
 hi baby u around?
 im lookin at nashville flights
 and from thurs night - sunday the flights are 500-600 USD
 but from wed - sunday  they are like 250
 so im thinking we should leave wed
 but wanted to check in with you and hear your thoughts
 Yeah 250 does sound better
 So you'd be ok with taking an extra day off?
 I fink so
 I just took a quick look, I'm getting 400ish for wed-sun
 Vaidu found it cheaper
 Delta round-trip she saw
 Jfk-nashville?
 Oh Nvm it's 341 pp
 Vs 500-60
 Weird
 Maybe there aren't many tickets lefy
 I got 397 cheapest on Wed and 487 cheapest on thur
 so vaidu stopped by the office
 and she could even notice the awkwardness between myself and my boss
 Fun
 it is
 i need to GTFO
 ASAP

 I might
 Although I'm still at home
 Poopin
 Lol
 Hey booper how's your day going?
 Ok. I started bawling in Alex's office
 Finally told him
 Awwwwwww hunnie
 He said to start looking and he would help
 \o/
 I'm glad he's on your side with this hunnie
 Seems like he's aware of how shitty the situation is
 He also said weird things like When I started he tried to mentor me, but stopped bc sarah called him  and told him to stop mentoring and if he wanted to continue he needed to go thru her
 Which is really odd
 I think they are moving all my work back into my old team
 So that's why I feel like I'm in limbo
 That really is so bizarre
 But he said he would help
 So yay
 Thats great hunnies
 He's probably got some really helpful connections
 Yeah
 I just wanna hug u and cry
 But he said to start looking
 And that from a management perspective it sounds weird
 Lol
 Aw
 But yeah I don't understand wtf is up
 Yeah I'm super on edge right now
 Hey huns I left work
 Hope you enjoy the show tonight
 I should be there around when you get out
 Hey hunns I just got to your apt

 Hoo boy I slept like it was my life's work
 Tried to stay awake till 8pm
 Fell asleep at 4pm
 Still slept till just now
 Aww yay!
 I tried to email recruiters on LinkedIn last night but I needed a better email so I ended up not applying to where I wanted yet
 So I feel semi useless :( but I ended up sleeping from 9:30-6
 And my stomach hurts still :/
 And I'm annoyed at work
 Can we do resume work over the phones tonight? I'm just pissy

 and vaidu has physically sending all my info from my email
 Ah
 Lol fun stufds
 BABY BABY BABY IM SO HAPPY
 Woooooo
 :D :D :D i want to go take you and vaidu to steakums and eat my weight in steaks to celebrate
 Oh huns
 so i was supposed to hear back from Orchard today
 to "wrap things up"
 i havent heard AT ALL.
 im so bummed
 silence is not usually a good thing
 one more hour until im busy again
 You'll get it huns
 I dunno what they're doing
 ughhhhhh fml fml fml
 they dont want me. no emails or calls. D:
 should i email him back or just wait
 or give up hope?
 im banking on giving up hope right now and eating my feelings
 i cant freak out to beata and vaidu
 they dont want to hear it
 so im going to stop
 Honeys just give it a little time
 and ill freak out to u instead
 It's gonna be okay
 what if they found someone else
 Then you'll find another company
 You will
 ps since i have it up, this is one unit we are seeing this weekend: http://streeteasy.com/building/1n4th-1-north-4-place-brooklyn/ph1b
 i cant stay here for any longer tho
 i just cant do it.
 But there's a good chance they're just getting stuff ready
 That's a nice place huns
 But why
 It's so expensive and it's in Williamsburg
 bc its pretty and has all the ammenities we want
 is that expensive? its 2500 but it has gym in building, laundry in unit so we wouldn't have any other expense except for interwebs and cable if we wants.
 and its a month free so we could prob get the rent lower
 sigh
 i hate my life
 I'm just comparing it to the really nice apt we saw back in Jan
 It was cheaper than 2500pp
 And it's in Manhattan, so most likely the places you want to go will be much closer
 Seems like a waste to go to bk unless the apt really is super nicr
 true. but this one didnt have that extra 60/month fee for gym, nor the laundry i'd have to pay for
 I thought it had laundry in unit
 the other one no
 had a laundry room
 I think we're talking about different ones
 im talking about the one we almost got
 im only comparing to that one
 I was comparing to the one with the really nice view
 My thought is you'll be more isolated in bk than where that one was
 whic one w/ the reallynice view
 But maybe there's more to do than I realize
 the one we almost got but it fell thru right
 No
 the other one
 with floor to ceiling windows?
 The one that had the floor to ceiling windows
 aha i see
 this is true
 Idk what stuff is around you
 In bk
 Maybe a lot
 williamsburg is basically like another village
 i saw this one too
 http://www.abingtonproperties.com/buildings/4
 That one just links me to their main site
 park ave south is the building
 I really wanna go home bro
 I need to get some supplies for food tho
 Namely wraps
 aw
 what kinda supplies?
 Possibly beans as well
 aw
 I only have a giant can of black beans and I feel like that's too much for just 2-3 dinners
 co-op?
 i thought you were making chicken?
 I made chicken this morning
 But I want a burrito
 With said chicken
 I had a pretty good vegetarian salad for lunch
 ooh
 I used chickpeas as the main protein source
 Pretty filling
 ooh
 i didnt know u did veggie that seriously
 what made you change? cheaper or less thought to put together or both?
 I just don't like meat in salads I make
 Doesn't taste good versus fresh veggies
 There was no avocado ripe enough to do the job
 So then it would have been a.....avocano
 Baby
 Hello
 Helllloooo
 ugh
 something is bothering me
 What's bothering you hun
 this whole vaidu thing
 once i apologized its like its all my fault and i dont htink she understood why i was mad and why i was also right on some things i said
 shes just hanging on to the fact that shes right
 and it bothers me
 You guys should probably have a talk about what's going on
 Kinda thought you would
 i have tried
 u have no idea
 -___-
 It's gonna be hard to not lash out at each other like you did on sun
 You gotta be able to shut that down on her end and your end
 but she insists that im in the wrong
 and i am not.
 lack of communication goes both ways, bruh
 Yeah it does
 and the other hting is that she says she wants space
 but then kicks me out
 im going up to see you.
 where is her going to see my parents?
 why cant she make the effort to give me space?
 Does she have ppl or places she can go to?
 she will say no. but i mean....she can at least just go home
 and then the final thing is that shes like oh i thought you were there to support me. like i dont have shit on my plate to just drop all my problems bc she needs me
 like ive been going thru shit since JANUARY
 shes been going thru it FOR A MONTH
 and she cant understand that?
 i even told her maybe weshouldnt live together
 Maybe you can help her understand what's going on
 and she was like yeah maybe we souldnt
 but that was just spiteful
 But like
 Did you bring it up as a discussion or was it like an attack
 i just want this stupid apartment thing to go thru
 And what about her end
 i just said it while we were on the topic
 and she lashed out saying it spitefully
 and the other thing is that she is comparing herself to me
 and thinks that orchard is a more stable company that hightower.
 so she feels like shes at the shitty end of the stick
 and the fact that saad told her she made the wrong decision
 shes of course now thinking she made the wrong call too
 bc thats what saad told her.
 Jesus
 like she makes decisions, then lashes out at me when she doesnt like them?
 at least own up to it
 and its not even a month in
 I mean I wouldn't get up on your high horse about that tho
 shes just not giving it a chance
 rushing to conclusions
 and its making her miserable
 shes been telling me how she has to work harder there bc the technology doesnt come to her as easily as blk did (bc she knew the technology here at blk really well). and how shes not being onboarded or trained correctly
 It's useful to get some distance to gain perspective but also incredibly hard
 and im thinking that this is how it is when ur not part of a program
 but im not going to just say thats how i felt in every one of my jobs
 im just going to be ike oh, well try to reach out to the right people i guess to get urself up to speed
 So much drama man
 its just....
 i dont get it.
 Unrelated question
 u just started a job
 u knew nothing about the industry
 Are chickpeas okay to eat if theyve sprouted
 give it a fair shot
 whatchu mean sprouted?
 i would thikn yes
 bc thats how bean sprouts are made
 Oh I see
 Okay
 http://www.seriouseats.com/2011/04/how-to-grow-bean-sprouts-in-a-jar.html
 But yes like a bean sprout
 my mom did it with lentils all the time
 youre cool
 Looks like a mini potato
 just let em sprout a bit more
 My salad will get soggy tho
 why?
 u sprout them in a seperate contianer
 drain them on paper towels
 then add to salad?
 Lol I just mean they're currently on my salad and I wanna eat rm
 oh
 then yes
 i havent eaten yet :(
 I just started eating
 lol chomp chomp chomp
 i lost more weight baby
 :D
 I've been interrupted by people several times since then tho
 That's good hunnies
 im finally not fatty
 You were never fatty babers
 well, im officially not medically overweight
 ðŸ˜Ž
 lmao
 Any news about the apartment biz?
 nope. not yet.
 Okie
 Well
 we officially submitted all paperwork incl. dads
 Hopefully stuff goes your way
 Ah
 i called the ppl at the old apt company to follow up to cloes my incident
 and we ahve more apt viewings set up this week
 and we have a month to move
 so....
 off to a good start
 Sounds like you're doing the best you can
 we are seeing this one today http://streeteasy.com/building/159-bleecker-street-new_york/5a
 Wow the whole "renovated open kitchen" is really a stretch
 But it looks nice
 lmao yup
 And it's super close to where you are now
 I particularly like the bottom of picture number 2
 did u say something to vaidu?
 she just said this: Btw I said this before but just wanted to say it again. Sorry for my part in our fight on Sunday.
 No I haven't spoken to her since I left
 interesting
 ooh we are having a good talk now tho
 you should be proud of me
 i realized that i was just doing OK w/ my shit alone, but i guess i couldnt really handle anything else.and youve been super good w/ that but vaidu needed me when i couldnt help her out and then we blew up
 I GOT ANOTHER OFFER
 same cash comp
 increased shares to 7.5k
 june 1st start date
 So many good things
 I'm so proud hunns
 thank you
 thank you for being there for me babers
 i know this cant be easy on you
 we can celebrate soon once everything is official
 Looking forward to it hunns
 ðŸ˜
 Guess who
 <Media omitted>
 Babbbbby
 Baaaaaaaaaaby
 Jesus that's unnerving
 That's Vaidu
 Obviously
 But still
 Really creepy
 Lmao
 Isn't it great
 Love snapchat filters man
 hi hi
 i need u to tell me that im not making a mistake.
 With orchard?
 yes.
 Do you like the company?
 yes
 Do you like what they do and the ppl you met?
 and i like the people 1000x more than this.
 Okay
 So you're good
 Don't over think it hunns
 im not 100% sold on what they do, but i trust the pepole that run it
 andi think i will be learning more for my overall career there
 than staying here
 You got a good offer too
 7.5k shares and a signing bonus
 And you get paid about as much as you do at blk+bonus
 is it wrong to tell my boss and see what they counter for me to stay?
 i dont want to stay.
 im just nervous
 idk why
 You can go ahead if you want but I wouldn't just ask them to keep you
 Money doesn't equal retention
 i know.
 i know im undervalued here
 im just...idk
 hesitating
 You're nervous
 That's pretty understandable
 But you don't like where you are now
 And I'm pretty sure you're aware
 But you need to leabe
 You need to get out
 i know.
 this is weird
 You're good
 im existing
 i feel weird
 weeeeird. weird.
 Thats the feeling of freedom babers
 Lol

 Also I've been drinking fresh squeezed orange juice
 That shits da bomb
 It's my main food group ATM
 Dude yes it's so freaking good
 Bagels and oj
 Vitamix and oranges?

 Ezactly
 Plus regular oj sits in vats for like a year
 That shit is whack
 That's gross
 They manually color it orange
 I can feel my sinuses drowning in phlegm
 And when I lie down I feel it shift within the sinus cavity
 I hate that feeling
 Kinda like waves
 I'm really sexy
 Have you tried using mucinex?
 It sometimes helps
 Advil cold and sinus bro. I think it has the same meds in it
 I don't want to mix too much
 Ucinex is different I think
 Already on a high dosage of drugs
 But idk about drug combinayions
 Ooh maybe then
 Ima look it up
 What's for dinner babers
 It doesn't have acetometaphen
 Simple pasta dish
 Rigattoni with tomato and pepper
 Oh

 That sounds good
 I was gonna add broccoli too but there was already too many veggies
 Oh also it has hot Italian chicken sausage
 Sounds good dude ðŸ‘ðŸ¼

 Omg
 Saskia got assaulted last night
 What??
 And we're trying to figure out what happened. All we know is that she's been in hospital and police station all day, is going home soon
 Is she okay
 Holy shit
 She was taking the subway back at 2:30 am from manhattan to bumblefuck Brooklyn
 She fell asleep
 Woke up to a fucking hipster forcing himself in her mouth
 Shit
 She confronted him, he assisted her and busted her lip
 No idea where Ilya was, why she was alone that late, etc.
 I told her to go home get some sleep and then call me and I'll go over there ASAP.
 Yeah
 She also said not to tell anyone bc she's still processing it but Beata already told Greg so it's only a matter of time until I told u
 I won't tell anybody
 But yeah that's not an easy thing to go through
 But seriously, I'm silently raging all day. Where was Ilya? Why did he let her go home alone that late at night? What was she doing out?
 So she's hopped up on a ton of meds, gave her std and hiv drugs etc. the guy got away as far as I know.
 The police were really nice to her too so that was good
 Damn
 They don't have any cameras on the subway?
 They do but I guess he wore a hoodie?
 It was some freaking hipster too. RAAAAGE
 Sigh. And on top of this my moms being weird today. So all around stellar day. But my mom thing seems so trivial now
 Yeah serioualy
 I would make sure saskia has someone to help her through this stuff
 I already offered, and I told her to call me when she's awake
 That's good
 I'll tell Vaidu to reach out to her and give her the name of her therapist in case she wants to go that route
 That's good
 Does she have someone to spend time with her now?
 Idk. I offered and she said she just wanted to sleep, she'd been awake for about 30 hrs or so
 And said she just wanted to get some sleep
 So I'll give her a call later
 Sounds like a decent plan
 ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¼ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¼ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¼
 What is ur take on the ballet flat?
 Yay? Nay?
 Yea definitely
 They look nice
 Interesting
 Most men hate them
 Should we just break up since this situation isn't fair to either of u but esp not u and if it's going to be like this for the next four years what's the point really
 That is a really weird segway to make
 We should maybe not discuss it through text messaging I think
 Okay
 I just took a hot shower and came to the decision that the easiest thing is to just dump everyone and run away from my problems. So here I am, running away.
 You can't run away from your problems bro
 They're the only things you take with you when you run
 U can if u try hard enough
 Also on my way home from work yesterday a bird took a crap and it landed on my neck in between the back of my neck and my shirt and I had to walk to my car and drive home with bird shit all over my neck and shirt
 Oh noooo
 Isn't that supposed to be good luck tho
 It was probably the most disgusting thing that's happened to me in a while and I thought you would appreciate it
 If a bird craps on u
 Lmao
 I'm pretty sure it's intrinsically bad luck
 Like what are the odds of the poo landing right on the back of my neck
 Exactly. Very small odds. Aka YAY U WERE THE CHOSEN ONE
 Maybe the bird picked u from a distance
 Lol we see this situation very differently
 And flew above u while it's shit was a brewing
 U should have zig zagged
 I thought it had started to rain at first and I touched the back of my neck
 Ewwwww
 It was so nasty man
 Did u smell it
 I had to make it the whole way home without touching my left hand to anything
 Maybe
 I needed to know it wasn't just some kid throwing food
 Lmao
 /sigh
 I'm so messed up
 What would u be comfortable doing? Just staying tonight and leaving tomorrow? Or me standing up to my mom and having her leave?
 I'll support whatever you do hun
 I do feel more comfortable leaving on Sat but if you wanna have me stay that's okay too
 Also
 <Media omitted>
 Ok if ur more comfortable leaving then you can leave
 I just hate this so much
 It's not fair to u at all
 U don't deserved this. Oooh hold on u reminded me

 Of course I do hunnigans
 So uhh I'm on my way to a leetle bar called torst
 Lol
 ðŸ˜ðŸ˜
 This place is so different dude
 <Media omitted>
 Looks the same
 But is much more crowded and noisier
 And super loud music
 A lot is brewed at two roads
 <Media omitted>
 Yeah
 We should go
 Next time you're up
 Yay
 This weekend?
 Did u buy ur shoos
 Not yet not yet
 I hear there's a pretty cool shoe shop near you
 lol
 i just bought jeans that fit (yay!)
 face wash bc we ran out
 and some stuff for dinner
 So I think we can take a later flight down
 Check in isn't until 3pm
 So we should grab the 1:50 flight
 No sense in getting there that far before check-in
 also i havent had a chance to get any furniture
 so idk whats going on
 hey babers
 sounded like you were busy yest. i hope you have a good week
 and i cant wait to see you soon
 Hey huns I'm sorry I was so short yesterday
 I was getting frustrated from working the other day and I ended up getting on the phone with George just before you called
 I'm excited to see you hunnigans
 Also I would recommend looking directly on chase.com if you can for flights
 United is not the fanciest airline but I found a round-trip for 44k points or $550 or some combo of the two
 Apparently chase has the highest ROR on united and Southwest
 It's UA1586 out and UA1587 back
 That's what I was doing, was directly on chase last night
 I see
 It's fine, I'd rather you just tell me next time you're busy and that nows not a good time instead of just dealing with me and being short.
 And on my part i can begin each call with "is now a good time to chat" if that would help as well
 I don't care what flight we take as long as checked luggage is free
 We check in at 3 so I think it makes the most sense to land around then so we can get to the resort after 3
 And since its sat to sat when we come back doesn't matter, our apt is open for both u and Emily until Sunday in case we get in late and you'd like to just travel back up on Sunday
 Also that was the round trip deal I was getting with JetBlue on chase
 Hi I need advice for like 2 quick seconds
 What's a good cut of beef to get for stir fries
 Skirt steak is good
 London broil if you're trying to save money
 Everything here is super cheap
 I saw chicken on managers Special for 80 cents a lb
 The whole package for 2 bucks
 The whole thing will be low enough cost
 So ill try skirt
 Ty
 And how long do I cook it for
 Recommend browning a couple mins per side then on med high for 10ish min with veggies
 Double check a stir fry recipe to make sure tho
 One I saw says filet
 You gotta cut it into strips
 Yeah
 I see some precut
 That's pretty easy
 What's chuck filet
 It's like a London broil level of cut
 You can use it for stir fry
 It's not super high quality but it's decent enough
 I just grabbed skirt like u said Ty babers
 Np hunns
 And Montreal steak seasoning?
 I like it
 It might be a bit much for a stir fry but you can get away with using some
 Just don't go crazy with it
 it turned out amazing
 i ended up grabbing spicy montreal steak seasoning and it was perfection
 so thank you :)
 what do you have going on for the rest of the week?
 do u think we can chat either tonight or tomorrow night?
 ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¼ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¼ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¼ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¼ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¼ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¼ good luck on that server issue today Huns. Hope it's good news
 Thanks huns, me too

 We can't play ping pong today tho

 Puppppppy it's like I have a free puppppppy

 That dog is also only 11 months
 Bacon pockets babe
 You know this

 I didn't know. The CEO isn't here so it's not his pup
 I didn't think Chico was gonna visit bro
 Oh but I have no pockets today
 Bacon stuffed bra?
 Nah that's just inviting trouble
 Looool
 She's back yay
 Lol just one hand on the mouse and the other for pets
 She lost her tennis ball

 Lol so sounds like you're just gonna hang out with the office dog today
 This isn't even the office dog! This is great!
 <Media omitted>

 She ended up picking it up

 What's a trc
 Course I know what day it is
 Technical review committee
 Big review meeting for projects
 Ooh
 Hope it's good news bro
 It'll be good
 I'll get a bunch of praise and most of the questions will be the reviewers trying to follow how I fixed everything
 I'm kind of a big deal
 Lmao
 I miss u
 It's not fair u work with incompetent ppl
 I miss you too hunns
 I don't work with incompetent people per se
 It's just that 80% of our competent modelers have left over the past few years
 We've got a crop of newbies
 U keep defending these idiots
 I'm just sad, sorry
 I know I know
 I honestly can't say much bad about this specific project team tho
 I'm working with probably the best PM in the company
 Our project director is really good too, although he has no sense of what's practical vs what we could do if we had unlimited money and time
 that doesnt sound like hes good then
 im going to stop talking now
 He's not a business guy
 It's weird
 He's like the tolling guy tho
 ðŸ˜—ðŸ˜—
 *boops*
 ðŸ˜˜
 Oh also, I've been listening to the back catalog of sysk on their homepage, and a good amount of the episodes have transcripts with little pictures of Josh and chuck to tell you who's speaking
 It's pretty funny reading through and seeing just how clumsy the dialogue sounds in written form
 Highly recommended
 ill take a look
 ðŸ‘‹ðŸ½
 hows it goin
 It's going
 There are like 4 people asking me for stuff at once man
 I'm tired and I think I'll take a nao

 Just go straight there when you get back, don't even sit down in your apartment when you get home

 baby our sofa came in
 and it was the wrong thing
 only half of it came in (like, id have to order the sectional part seperately)
 they had specifically told us the piece we got was the whole sofa, not just one part of it....on the phone with them now
 so shes like oh i can give you a discount.
 .....i thought this was the entire thing, bitch.
 YOU TOLD ME IT WAS THE ENTIRE THING
 Shit
 I hope you get that sectional for free
 That's bait and switch
 I would just tell them to take it all back if they're not gonna do it
 we have the pickup delivery tomorrow
 from 5-7
 Ah
 so now what
 -____-
 We need to exchange our tv
 ðŸ˜“
 It just broke (it has a line in it)
 Can u help
 Jeez
 I can bring my car down if you want
 So you can return
 We're gonna call Best Buy and see what's easiest
 I hate my life
 Damn that's bad luck there
 You'll get it all sorted out soon
 Ugh
 It's a blue line in the screen
 :/
 Defective unit
 They'll replace it I'm sure
 Still sucks

 FUUUUUCK THAT
 Yeah
 These guys are fucking crazy
 lol
 they dont have the funds bro
 maybe its part time
 who knows

 2-5 years of applied machine learning too
 Dude that's a 150k salary job easy
 Youd have to work 5 hours a week to justify 20k
 i just ordered sandals!

 https://www.instagram.com/p/BGKrshzIh9b/

 Do do do
 <Media omitted>
 mah outfiiiiits. with mah new jeans
 Loookin good hunns
 the scale said i gained weight
 :(
 The same scale that said I gained weight after a large poo?
 no
 we bought new ones
 I have yet to perform the poo test on them so I can't attest to the accuracy of your new scale
 Speaking of, the scale at the fitness room tells me I'm heavier than 200 pounds but also lighter than 200 pounds
 It's one of those slidy scales
 I'm >150+50 and <200
 Go figure
 did u call me
 <Media omitted>
 Also I apparently don't digest quinoa
 did it just come out whole?
 bc you might have to chew your food lol
 under armour is having their end of the season sale if you perchance needed workout or lounging gear
 Hmm
 I think I'm okay
 Bonobos is having a sale tho
 I might get some more pants
 i gots an email
 lol im just spreading the woooord
 oh
 i work across the street
 want me to check it out?
 Lol you don't buy stuff at the bonobos store
 yeah but i an go check out stuffff
 duh
 uh duh
 you should get some then
 if their pants fit you well
 get a pair of chinos too
 so its semi cas
 and something else to wear on weekends which arnt jeans
 when u have to semi dress up (for dinners out and stuff)
 baberz
 look at this name
 https://bonobos.com/products/national-panthems?color=red%20white%20and%20blue&pant-fit=straight&pant-length=36
 Looool
 they are kind of epic....
 also i like some of the shorts from there too
 <Media omitted>
 Theres this Japanese sushi place near me
 Look at the protein to rice ratio
 DamÃ± son
 That's a lot of fish
 Ikr
 What color chinos would you recommend buying?
 If you have a blue one that would work well w/ lighter shirts
 A khaki would go well w/ darker or more colorful shirts
 I know I don't like khakis but they would match
 Yeah I'm avoiding khakis cos I know you don't like them
 Aw that's nice of u
 But it might match in this case
 A light grey would work similarly
 They don't have blue
 They have jet blue in my size
 Pic?
 Sapphire is sold out
 https://bonobos.com/products/stretch-washed-chino?color=jet%20blues&pant-fit=slim&pant-length=32&pant-waist=35
 They have super light blue chinos too
 Lemme see?
 I like those
 https://bonobos.com/products/summer-weight-chinos?color=wisteria
 https://bonobos.com/products/summer-weight-chinos?color=navy&pant-fit=slim&pant-length=32&pant-waist=35
 These are darker blue summer weight
 Summer weight or linen would be good
 Keeps u cool
 Ya
 Do you like the light blue or navy tho
 i like both. idk how bright the light blue is in person
 but it hink you can pull both off.
 u just need ur summer shoos
 a nice cognac/caramel/brown colored boat shoe would be legit as well
 i think you'd get the most use out of the darker neutral tho
 I ended up getting 2 work pants and the Navy summer chinos
 (and ur toms would work as well)
 nice
 Only one item was on sale but it's w/e
 well u need it, cant really be helped
 and its not like any other pants fit u
 I was gonna get pants anyway
 *thumbs up*
 ðŸ‘ðŸ½
 i was thinking of you the other day, and laughed bc i was like hmmm i should take u boxer breifs shopping. ðŸ˜ðŸ˜
 Lol
 I'm at an event babers
 Call u later
 Okay
 Baby I made a mistake with those stuffed pepps
 They sustain me for approximately one hour
 Did i interrupt something
 No
 :/ okay
 i has coupon for spa castle for us
 this weekend
 Oo nice
 My pants came my pants came
 ðŸ‘–ðŸ‘–ðŸ‘–
 Theyre tighter than the other ones I've tried on but I think they're okay
 Can u bring the down pls
 And can u return in store?
 I think I can, I'm not sure though
 <Media omitted>
 These are the chinos
 Clean ur room lol
 I had a feeling you would say that
 I think u need other shoes with them tho
 Boaty mcboatface shoes

 I gots new shoes
 <Media omitted>

 I don't think I have been eating enough this week
 I've been so tired
 Ur wasting away
 *feeds you*
 Or maybe u have ur period
 ðŸ¤”
 Maybe
 I have been bleeding quite a bit from my vagina
 That's prob it bro
 Dude I got 300$ heels for 20$
 Bc club Monaco ppl messed up
 Woop woop
 Fuck quinoa bro
 Fuck stuffed pepps
 Lol aw
 Babers
 U should do a blend of rice to quinoa
 Baby no dont you defend quinoa
 It knows what it did
 Aw
 I sorry
 I'm on a shopping high right now
 I think it has to do with the calories
 Apparently quinoa has 222 calories per cup
 Yeah that's why ppl eat it
 But it's more protien
 And 170 per 1/4 uncooked
 Than rice
 So that's why u should do a mix
 So I'm eating max 400-500 calories per meap
 No fucking wonder
 I eat 2 meals per day
 Plus a pbj which is maybe 400-500 cals
 Aw
 1500 cals are u on a cut
 Check ur abs bro
 Count me
 I need like 3x those calories
 Em*
 I'm wasting away
 Pls get a pizza
 Lol
 I actually had pizza today
 It was a going away lunch for a couple guys in the office
 I had the equivalent of about 2-3 slicds
 Only abt 400-500 calories in itself
 But more filling than what I've been eating
 Baby no
 If I pooped our froyo Would u have a bite?
 ðŸ¤”
 Dude brexit :(
 ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¼ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¼
 what the plan? assuming its your usual 630 train down, here by 9?
 Yeah I think so
 It would be a 547 train I think

 So we'd have to meet somewhere that's cool having my backpack

 I'm still up for a meet up in the city tho if you gotta place you want to est
 Eat

 ur backpack can meet us anywhere tbh. its usually not an issue
 Okies

 Is it just gonna be you and me?

 Okay

 I've been wanting to get a board for a while but that's not really dinner
 We could find a place nearby

 aka we have the night to ourselves
 http://www.yelp.com/biz/sort-of-wine-bar-williamsburg?osq=Charcuterie

 Points out errors in giant ass spreadsheets and doesn't try to fix them
 Just wastes everyone's time

 How do I do the filters on Snapchat
 I'm like a grandma
 I don't know this technology
 U have to touch the screen until u see it track ur face on a grid thing
 So turn the selfie thing on
 And then hold down the screen
 Then swipe
 U should also have location services on for snapchat bc some filters are local
 It's not working
 Eh I'll figure it out later
 Update ur app
 I might need to
 Then just hold it downs bro
 I haven't opened it in a while
 Yeah u have to update
 Next time u and Sean should face swap
 It will basically be the same person lol
 Vaidu and I confuse snapchat

 ^rub for the ribs
 Let me know if you don't have anything in those
 Also liquid smoke would be good but isn't necessary
 We have liquid ammonia
 Aminos* which is the same thing I think
 Apparently phenols are the important components in liquid smoke
 Btw floors are vacuumed and swiffered. Only room i didn't touch is vaidus room. I left the boxes on the couch just in case you wanted to return the furniture
 Also if you are coming to the gym bring water
 Cooler is just aout out
 Ok
 Cooler Is what
 Almost out of watet
 Water
 Ok
 There's maybe one cup left
 I gotta chill before gym, I'm still full from lunch we grabbed

 Like a new person I bet
 Yeah
 Yesterday was not easy
 Aww
 I have had a four day stomach ache
 Aww
 And we're apparently having fried chicken at work today
 Oof
 Not great with a stomachache
 Is it from stickys finger joint?
 Lmao
 Asking the right questions
 I dunno
 You have enough food to last you even without dem lunches
 And wow I forget how much I eat when i have a hangover
 For dinner I ate 2 burrito bowls and a thing if chips and guac
 Not quite the size of Chipotle bowls but not far off
 I ate for like 45 mins straight after we hung up

 Killed 3 mosquitos since I woke up so I figured it was tine
 Time

 Lol I raided from back to front then left immediately after
 I'm gonna open the windows when I get home and then go food shopping while it airs out
 I have what looks like some small bug bites on my abs ðŸ˜‘
 omg id be ok if i never saw food again
 actualy thats a lie but thats how my stomach feels right now
 Awww

 Kefir?
 i had some yogurt already bro. w/ honey
 Baby my abs are not 2mm in diameter
 not with that attitude
 Lolz
 Brat diet today?
 Or Indian food?
 well im in a bootcamp from 9-2
 so i guess trying ot pick around the food they give me
 kinda day
 Awww
 Maybe you can make a request
 which is chicken collard greens
 etc
 they already ordered bc its our founders bday today
 and he picked fried chicken
 Oh I see
 so a lot of water i guess
 Well there's no shame in getting bland food cos your stomach is dieing
 Ppl would understand
 i know
 Tho chicken and collards sounds pretty great
 but i wont have time.
 U want me to seamless lunch for u babers?
 until 2pm
 no im ok
 ill go grab a smoothie bowl later
 What's a smoothie bowl?
 its a smoothie but they make it thicker
 so you eat it in a bowl and they add toppings like fruit nutbutters granola etc
 you'd like it
 Whaaaaaat
 How have I not known about this before
 idunno
 That sounds amazing
 u could get it at that liquiteria from equinox
 http://www.liquiteria.com/bowls/

 i dun goofed
 i ate the fried chicken
 w/ nashville hot sauce
 such shame
 baby i got my period
 Hoo man
 Wow hope you're feeling alright
 That's a lot to happen all at once
 Sounds delicious tho
 lol
 ikr
 I've been weirdly focused today
 Was taking a call at 10 and just stayed in the conference room working till just now
 im so proud of you
 apparently today is national fried chicken day
 yay i guess?
 You're doing chicken everywhere proud
 now we got pizza
 im sorry
 i wont fit on the plane to DR
 Wow damn son
 Your workplace is pretty generous
 its jons bday
 this doesnt happen every day
 well i guess i lied there were ice cream sandwhiches yesterday for another  bday
 Lool
 So just roughly 30 days out of the year
 BUT IT ONLY  HAPPENS ON FANCY OCCASSIONS
 Or however many ppl you have in the officd
 well 62 days out of the year i guess
 im having another slice. OINK OINK
 Eh let's round down due to multi birthday days
 OINK OINK MOTHERFUCKERS
 lmao
 theres only one multiple bday day
 and its mine
 :(
 I could build you a rough number based on factorials or whatever
 Booo
 i have the company bday list brooo
 i think im ok
 :P
 Statistically there should be more double days than that
 You reach an expected match of 0.5 persons at only 20 ppl I thino
 ðŸ¤“ðŸ¤“
 Nm I was thinking something else
 Your office has a 97% chance of having at least one match
 I've been trying to explain stats for 2 hours straight
 I'm sort of stuck on math mode
 I think you have a 96% chance of having 2 matches also
 im gaining so much weight today omfg
 i will probably hate myself tomorrow
 but i am weak today
 Your office size has a 45% chance to have 10 shared person-bdays
 I need help
 O wait no
 Your expected number of birthday occurrences is 3.4ish
 baby
 no
 stop
 come back to normal jim pls

 have a good day huns
 a friendly reminder to email fitbit to get ur replacement (its on my list too i keep forgetting -____-)
 someone bought in levain cookies
 ........HALP ME
 IM ON A DIET
 (its day 1 of a diet n exercise program. goes for 8 weeks, will take a small break on it when im in the dominican)
 Awwww
 What's the diet and exercise program
 ive resisted chocolate from italy, cupcakes from sprinkles and levain bakery cookies today.
 Damn
 its w/ a nutritionist and customized to my goals.
 That sounds pretty kewl
 yes except now im starving like no other
 its bc i skipped part of bfast bc i thought it was too much food
 now i know why it was a lot
 Oh I aee
 I think my laptop finally died on me btw
 oh no
 get a new one?
 oh i saw a cool looking laptop the other day
 Lolz
 What kind
 i forget
 but it was beautiful
 Oh I see
 Dave and George have been giving me recommendations for laptops too
 I think they're looking for new ones themselves
 http://store.hp.com/wcsstore/hpusstore/Treatment/Spectre_Saf_Gallery_th1.jpg
 hp spectre
 Oh yeah I was looking at that
 It's pretty
 yup. GORG
 http://www.techinsider.io/most-beautiful-laptops-2016-4
 those are all super pretty
 from having an air, i'd say the price increase to get a lightweight laptop is worth it
 esp with the amount you travel, i'd say it should be a priority for you. you wont understand how great it is until u get a thinner laptop.
 I don't know if the HP has enough power
 But I'm gonna keep looking
 i mean, there are a lot of thin ones out there
 doesnt have to be that. im just saying i think it would benefit you to see that as a necessary spec, thats all.
 ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¼ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¼
 Hi hunnies
 I hope you have a good day
 I had a weird night but I'm awake this morning

 We got this
 Aww I just missed out on a koffing
 idk what that is
 but im sad for u
 oh the farty guy
 yay i have him
 Lolol
 The farty guy
 haha baby look https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/4sn2rf/how_do_you_like_your_eggs/d5anraq
 Lol
 Eggs woodhouse
 You get any 10km eggs yet?
 NO
 but apparently u can
 TIL
 Yeah
 I haven't either
 I got mostly 5km eggs
 i have 2 and 5
 Got a sand shrew this morning from one
 The servers are down for me rn tho
 I wanna strangle my coworker baby
 He is so shitty
 There's a deadline for numbers to be out this friday
 I had been under the impression the numbers were due three weeks from this friday
 He told me today
 ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡ðŸ˜¡
 <Media omitted>
 Damn
 I literally have no idea how I'm supposed to get usable numbers by then
 They'll have next to no qaqc
 I would have cced his boss on that email
 He just went on vacation today...
 And had been like hi it's a little late for y to tell me now how long did u know about this
 Still
 I feel like this is calculated
 So he knows when he gets back
 It probably is
 He knew about this but I guess he assumed the info would have made it to me sooner? Idk
 Does he have to do anything once u give him those numbers
 Yeah
 Lots of shit
 I would set up a meeting with his boss and him
 And be like listen, we have to work together but fucking hell stop being such a bad employee
 He's tying to pin his negligence on u
 So he can have an out. "Jimmy didn't get me the numbers in time!"
 He's always comes back weeks later and says different shit
 Well u have documentation
 No I mean the higher ups know how good I am
 It just gives me shitty stressful situations in the interim
 He's just not good at managing
 There's an easy way to out politic him
 I feel like the office tries hard to prop people up like that
 Which is fine but it tends to breed incomplete
 Incompetence*
 Dude go over his head
 Send an email to his boss
 He is on vacation bro
 Yes
 I'd still send the email
 Is there any way u can get it done
 And send it to him right before the meeting
 So he has no time to do his shit? Are u in this meeting?
 I don't think so
 I honestly wouldn't be surprised if I was though and he just didn't tell me
 Sounds like he forgot, realized he forgot and was like welp I'll just email Jimmy once my boss isn't here
 Idk I just dont
 I've been teaching a new modeler with this project
 :(
 And I've been doing a bunch of work on a different oroject
 So I haven't been very involved
 Now I just need to do all the work in 2-3 days
 And then yell at him and my boss for being fucking morons
 Imo his boss is just as much at fault for this
 He should have told the client that it's 3 weeks early on a 7 week project
 So no way
 Barring that he should have told me about this directly
 Aw
 So u gonna do it
 Or just be like push the meeting
 ?
 Its a public outreach meeting
 No pushing it
 I was gonna go to trivia night with Dave today too
 :(
 U still should it's not ur damn fault
 I might
 I'll have to work a lot extra tmmr though
 :/
 Go blow off steam and come back tomorrow I guess. Idunno; it sucks both ways
 I'm sorry bro.
 How'd it go
 (I worked out yay!)
 So Dave came over and we ended up not getting to trivia on time
 But we just ended up hanging out
 Which was cool
 Lmao
 Nice dude nice

 Are still wfh this fri
 Idk
 Depends how much work I can get done today
 Ok
 Lemme know, I'll be flexible with my departure time
 Okay
 But I'd like to get there before 8 if I can
 So I can spend as much time with u as  possible
 Maybe even make dinner up there ðŸ˜‚
 Baby is it bad that I really want sooshi again?
 Lmao no
 It's not bad
 We can go it shall be mah cheat
 What is your meal plan btw
 Lets work around it
 <Media omitted>
 Friday and sat
 And Sunday is optional free day or just a combo of the other meals I've gots I think
 Two days or is that each day?
 I repeat this for 2 days
 So That's fri and sat
 Do you have these items?
 Yes
 I give her my grocery list every weekend and she makes meals to fit macros
 It's kinda cool
 Oh cool
 And then it's supposed to help me adjust macros as I move forward and learn this shit myself. plus work out plan that she gives me
 It's just to help me learn how to adjust macros etc bc I've never successfully done a cut before myself
 Nice
 Yeah. It doesn't leave much room for errors tho :/ so yah ðŸ˜
 This is how she does it when my lunch is catered
 <Media omitted>
 I see
 Sweet potatoes all day
 I found her on Reddit lol she's a licensed nutritionist and trainer who is also a clinical psychologist. It's weird but meh it's working and cheaper than doing this myself
 I bought these Japanese ones and omg they smell like candy when cooked
 And taste great. Idk wtf is in them
 Umm probably sweet potato
 Hopefully
 Smart ass
 ðŸ˜
 U enjoyed that
 Im counting it
 I can see ur stupid smile

 it is a weird feeling, i bet the space seems so much smaller than you remember it. i remember when i moved out of stamford, the feeling i got in the room all cleaned out was very unsettling
 i just wanted to tell you i love you and i miss you and when you get back to new haven put your passport ont he side or find it so you're not scrambling next weekend. i took the liberty of thinking through a lot of things we need for the vacation that you might not be thinking about so ive basically got you covered
 Aww I love you too. I'll grab my passport next time I get the chance
 okay. are you gonna be in stamford all weekend too? or intermittently? is your mom there/
 Probably all weekend, maybe more
 My mom is here though

 Dat polarization bro
 babe i need your passport
 info
 lets check in tonight
 My car got broken into
 Oh no
 What happened? Are you ok? What did they take?
 I don't know
 Looks like ten bucks in cash
 But I'm worried I had something important
 That I'm not accounting for
 I had an old wallet in there
 Make sure you have your passport, insurance cards etc on you now
 Call cc company and have them

 I'm worried I had my SS card or an ID with one in it
 Cc I have on me
 Also that would be too much
 If your wallet or purse containing your Social Security Card is stolen, contact your local police department immediately to file a theft report. You should also contact SSA directly at 1-800-772-1213 to request a replacement Social Security Card.
 did you file a police report already for this?
 (for ur car)
 https://oig.ssa.gov/report-fraud-waste-or-abuse/what-cant-oig-investigate
 I don't know if my SS card was stolen or not
 I'm looking for my keys to my lockbox
 I can't find those damn things wother
 ok
 well if you need to call to get a replacement or report theft thats how u do it. hopefully its somewhere.
 I'm not coming tonight
 Gonna have to file a police report and call ssa
 And ftc
 jesus, thats way more important. take care of that and let me know if there is anything i can help with please.
 Sure
 whats ftc?
 Federal trade commission
 They would be the ones to investigate and prosecute fraud
 oh. that makes sense
 im sorry this happened to you babe. keep me posted and i cant wait to spend next week with you.
 It just sucks man
 I have basically 24 hours to get this all done
 And I have to pack
 And also my entire apartment is upside down cos I was looking for the card
 i know babe, i know. want me to come up and help you pack? or maybe send u my packing list?
 Maybe the list but there's no point in you coming up
 dont worry about that apt. just get ur stuff in order
 and you can always meet us at the airport or head down late fri night to give you more time for this.
 Silver lining at least this is promoting me to throw shit out
 I already got rid of 3 garbage bags worth of junk
 Also my SSN already got stolen last year from bcbs
 wat
 did u just figure this out now?
 The cyber attackd
 No
 ohhhhh
 I've known about it since a year and a half ago
 They gave me free credit monitoring but it expires in about 6 months
 I signed up for monitoring of my own this afternoon
 good.
 my insurance does it for me
 i get a daily report from them in my email.
 geico..
 i saved 15%
 AND MORE
 Car insurance or apt?
 <Media omitted>
 Both
 OK so you wanna see something psych level suspicious?
 Yes
 <Media omitted>
 It's an offer for identity theft protection
 Lmao
 That's crazy
 I signed up for their competitor though so... I guess failed convoluted plan?
 Ruh Roh
 Better break a window next time to be sure
 ðŸ˜‘
 So guess whst
 What
 Turns out I didn't lose my SS after all
 ðŸ˜
 I found it in a different extra wallet
 ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬
 But umm
 Ummm?
 Should I call the police and tell them
 That I didn't have it stolen
 Lmao JK BROS LOL
 Yes
 Umm
 So they told me to call back later
 ðŸ˜
 My face right now
 I think they have a situation down at the precinct
 I'm happy but now I sound like a moron to all of the people I need to call back
 You're not a moron
 I told my landlord about it
 She is gonna review the tapes from the other night
 Cool
 Hey booper, now that I'm starting to get back to vacation stuff, can I send u my passport info for the check in?
 I'm so over it right now
 Send it but I won't be checking in until later
 I was all looking forward for your cuddles to soothe my cramps too ðŸ˜”

 http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=F_XaIuw6K6Q
 lol aw
 Babe call me back please
 Shit baby I'm so worried
 :(
 It sucks what happened
 I don't know
 Hopefully this will be a blessing in disguise for Vaidu
 I'm hoping it will. But /sigh
 Give her some time to figure out what she wants to do
 I will. I dunno what to do tonight
 Do I take her out for food? Bring her something?
 Just don't let her fall into the trap of thinking her coming back to the US was a mistake
 Maybe go get some food with her
 Maybe bring francis
 I'll do my best. I'm sure she blames herself for that move.
 Him hating his job and switching might help give her a little perspective
 Ooh good call. I'll talk to her and then I'll see if he can join. I'm so worried.
 Help her as much as you are able hunns
 If there's anything I can do I will do it
 Thanks babe I'm sure she will appreciate it
 Sure
 I think the best thing I would do is just help her to think positively
 I'm almost crying in this cab. Gotta dry up before I see her
 Then have her reach out to ppl for connections and job postings
 You got this hunns
 Be strong for her
 She has a great resume. She will land somewhere great
 Yeah
 If beatta is able to land a management position I'm sure Vaidu can find something that works well for her
 She took her practice gmat and got a 680. Which is impressive
 Just saying
 Lmao
 So there is no severance
 Just an extra 2 weeks
 Seriously?
 Really doesn't seem like the kind of place she should be working anyways
 Awe you're awesome baby I love you
 Aww I love you too Hunnies. An I did nothing. Vaidu has a good support system
 Plus she's talented. She'll be able to benefit from this a ton
 Aw
 You're sweet
 ðŸ˜—ðŸ˜—
 <Media omitted>
 ðŸ˜˜
 Lmao
 <Media omitted>
 Can I keep him
 <Media omitted>
 YAD
 Yas
 Baby I just had a thought
 If Vaidu is doing GMAT studying and has a different schedule than u
 You guys could totally get a pupper
 Lmao
 Baby
 my desk is still stuck standing
 bro
 Lolol
 Gonna be in shape
 its not even the correct height tho
 :(
 so sad
 Rough day bro
 my table is the perfect height for my tummy to sit on

 https://angel.co/pave/jobs/131740-data-scientist-consumer-marketing
 they reached out to beata, she said shes not looking but could reccommend someone
 if you are interested bro
 <Media omitted>
 I sent u her email and his contacts too
 i also saw this - https://angel.co/bond-street/jobs/60067-data-scientist
 What are your plans for Saturday
 https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/4xz2ly/is_this_legal/
 
 You up?
 You called?
 Yes. Last night. Wanted to talk before bed
 Everything okay? Or you just wanted to chat
 Just wanted to chat
 <Media omitted>
 Lol
 The weather is perfect today
 hey
 so my parents are going to probably be done with thir thing around 11pm/mdnight so they will most likely want to come over around that time.
 and my mom wants to see vaidu (blech i dont want to see mom but whatever)
 Okay hunn
 George got back to me. His flight lands at 10
 okay cool
 10pm right
 Yep 10pm
 Also can you give me the name of the leather bag place one more time
 cuyana
 https://www.cuyana.com/leather-travel-case-set.html#pearl-grey
 https://www.cuyana.com/leather-travel-case-set.html#olive
 Do you think blue brown or black?
 Or as an alternative
 https://www.cuyana.com/crossbody-pouch.html#stone
 i saw that too
 i liked it, whichever one you think she will use more
 Okay. I'm thinking she would probably use the purse more but idk
 She doesn't travel a ton except her drives up to Stamford once or twice per year
 they are just nice pouches
 doesnt have to be for travel
 can help her organize her purse, etc. or put her makeup in there, or whatever
 if u think she will use the bag more, get that.
 Right right
 its just a nice quality w/ a great price point and you get it engraved
 Okay yeah
 You're right
 I think the pouches are a little more personal
 Any pref on color?
 whats her favorite color?
 Ummm
 Possibly green
 if she likes bright colors then the blue or teal
 The purse I've seen her carry around is a light brown color kinda like your largish bag
 well it goes in the bag
 so she can either match it
 OR she can just have a bright pop of color
 for COLOR the blue, red or pistachio are pretty
 to match the grey, stone,  ecru, blush or olive
 wouldnt matter too much. i dont really know your moms well....but something is telling me the blue or teal would be good for her
 the pearl grey is nice
 the inside of that matches the outside of your moms bag
 and can match any other color bag or more less
 I'm asking Bruce if he knows what color her bag is
 I'll order based on that and your advice
 Oh also I got my new work laptop yesterday evening
 I've been setting it up today
 oh
 ps they havent found my camera yet
 :(
 :(
 Did they respond to you?
 yes
 they dont have an update
 i.e. it wasn't found
 I CALLED AS WELL
 Omg
 I hope they find it hunners
 Otherwise I know what I'm getting you for your bday
 lolol
 doooont you dont has to
 i really want to use that flight deal i saw to cambodia tho.
 Let's look into it hun
 It can be my vacation for the year
 the flight is way too cheap for me to just avoid it lol
 Lol
 BUT i'd want to go for like 2 weeks
 lets see
 Sure
 Yeah that's something we gotta discuss a good amount
 exactly.
 i also saw flights to eastern europe for 150 roundtrip
 but not like sweden or anything
 Whaa
 I guess there's not a lot of demand for eastern euro
 Esp right now
 http://thepointsguy.com/category/deal-alerts/
 he has a TON of them posted
 theres 400$ to milan/JFK
 ones to toyko, hawaii, etc
 Oo
 I would love to visit Japan and sweden
 i saw paris and london there too
 just bookmark that site lol
 Hawaii would be pretty sweet too
 Lol I should
 Also CERN
 Would be cool
 lol yep
 we could also swimg by denmark
 and go to NOMA
 swing*
 Yeah
 Maybe swim over to norway
 Hang out on some fjords
 yup.
 I also kinda still wanna check out some other us cities
 me toooo
 we havent done that
 West coast maybe?
 oh there was just a jfk to west coast (sf/la) eal for like a hundo RT
 but i fink it expired
 it was jet blue or soething
 Oo
 when they have their sale we should just jump on it next
 What time frame tho
 i dunno. usually what happens is one airline does a sale
 and the others are like NOT COOL BRO
 Yeah
 and sale too
 Generally it's 1-3 months from the date of sale
 From what I've seen at lesdt
 yeah. the jet blue 2 day sales are a much closer timeframe
 Do u ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¼ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¼
 Do I ðŸ‘‹ðŸ½ðŸ‘‹ðŸ½?

 WITHOUT QUESTIONS
 ðŸ‘‹ðŸ½ðŸ‘‹ðŸ½
 ðŸ‘ðŸ¼
 lol fail
 what are you doing now
 im so bored omg
 Hey hon
 Hey babers
 Did you reach out to the recruiter yet? Beata is asking
 He's reached out to her and i think she wants to know if she should mention you or not in a response
 I was gonna msg you this morning actually. There's no description of the position in the e-mail
 Or the company
 That's why I chatted you a link to it here
 https://angel.co/pave/jobs/131740-data-scientist-consumer-marketing
 Okay thanks
 Literally right before my chat saying I emailed u
 It's so many pages of text up in WhatsApp it might as well be lost
 True, good thing im here to scroll up for you
 I knew I kept you around for a reason
 Sure I guess it works
 Lol
 If you don't wanna do it u don't have to
 It's fine
 I don't fit any of the qualifications dealing with finance/marketing but I guess that doesn't matter at all
 Well if it's not what u want to do then u can let me know and I'll tell Beata not to push it
 Nah it's fine. I'll email the recruiter.
 So my most recent resume is on your laptop
 Oh. It's at home
 Damn
 And Vaidus at work
 I don't think I changed too much but I definitely modified one or two important points
 Do u think u can just email the guy and be like hey I got ur contacts from Beata when do u want to chat
 And then buy time until tonight?
 Idk
 Just email him
 And get him on a call to chat
 Or just send him what u have
 And talk to him
 I edited some stuff on my phone, it's reasonably up to date now
 You think this works?
 Sure babes. What works ?
 <Media omitted>
 ^
 That sounds great
 Add your phone number or say something more active at the end of the second paragraph
 What time works for you for us to chat
 Chat about the role*
 And then send :)
 Okay cool
 I'm ccing beata
 Sounds good
 Okay done
 Now i gotta get back to all the ppl who have been emailing me frantically about work nonsense
 Good luck
 Also is it cool if I come down tonight
 Woah
 Of course
 Are u packed now
 This is so sudden
 But I love it
 Lol
 I am driving down
 I have a backpack with some clothes but its nbd to run and get what I need
 Ok
 I have a weeks worth of boxers for u
 And socks
 Apparently
 Was hoping to fit a car wash/oil change in as well but the ppl I go to close too early
 Lol awesome
 I am apparently out of t-shirts as well
 Again
 lol
 what time do u think u will be here
 He just called lol
 I was not prepared
 I wrote notes in the conference room on drafting paper with dry erase markers
 lol
 you're my favorite
 how'd it go
 Fine I think. I was just lucky to close the concernce room door before he asked me anything too incriminating
 what did he ask u
 whats next steps
 i wasnt expeciting him to call like NOW
 lol
 Yeah I asked him what time works
 No warning yo
 It's good I picked up too, I had 2 spambot calls 15 minutes earlier
 oh no. did he ask u resume stuff or data science stuff
 is he gonna call u later?
 It was very standard recruitery stuff as far as I could tell
 Tell me about yourself
 What's your salary
 Are you focused on NYC or can other places work for you
 oh cool
 He said he'll get my resume to Pave and Cognical
 That's another similar company
 interesting
 he must be paid on commision or something, hes hustling.
 He's a recruiter not employed directly by any one company
 yeah, i thought they got a cut of the deals they made
 i could be wrong
 Seems pretty par for the course as far as my experience
 Most likely
 regardless, at least thats done and over with. at least the lead turned up.
 Yep
 He was saying 100k base range so that's reasonable
 good
 thats always negotiable but ta least the range is decent
 Yeah
 Equity would be nice
 yeah they typically will give that to u
 This guy moves fast
 I just got a call from him, he's got me a phone interview tmmr
 Everyone should be like him
 Yay congrats baby. Which one and when?
 Again I had to basically run to the conference room
 Yeah that's what I did at blk. "Could you please hold for a minute while I grab a room to chat"
 He's gonna send me an email
 Damn
 That guy is the usain bolt of recruiting ðŸ˜‚
 Lolz
 My chair is being fixed yay
 Woo
 Gonna raise my standing desk in celebration
 Desk* it's the transmission
 It does down and doesn't go back up
 It's at knee height now
 And I've commandeered the desk next to mine
 The transmission?
 That's what the dude said
 Whatever makes it go up is broken
 Is your desk an automatic or manual
 Automatic
 Bro
 How many mpg
 Lmao its electric
 Baby it's not a car
 (Boogie woogie woogie)
 Says u. You've never seen this baby before
 Does it have several gears while lifting a total of 3 feet?
 Vroom vroom
 Push that baby into 5th gear and it really purrs
 Lmao
 So What time are you expecting to be here's babe
 Probs late? 9?
 That'd be my guess, prob 9ish
 I have to stay till probably 630 today and I would guess traffic is not great before then anyways
 Okie
 Hey Hun I left work a little while ago
 Maps says 1hr 45ish
 Yay
 We're down the streets
 Word
 I would like to chill pls
 Save a seat for mee
 I'm gonna be full o booze
 Oooh YAS
 Let's do drink
 Have u had dinner?
 Or u wanna chill and grab eats too?
 I am gonna prob want food
 I did thai food Friday today cos I won't be here tmmr
 Ok
 So it was a good amt of food but I still need more
 Yeah we can grab food with you
 Cool
 It's gonna be late tho
 I'm not hungry
 It's fine

 <Media omitted>
 lol yup
 good luck on ur interviews hons
 Thanks babers
 Hey booper, do you like this as a follow up email?
 <Media omitted>
 I think it went pretty well, got a follow up call from Jesse like 2 minutes afterwards
 That dude is a hustler
 damn what did he say
 sounds good dude
 how was it
 I'm gonna send it off then
 That's the first thing he asked
 I think it went well
 Pretty standard first interview
 nice
 what else did he say? did u ask what their timeline looked like?
 in terms of hiring
 Info about me, then a series of questions about building a model, then my questions for him
 It was supposed to be 30 mins, went 45ish
 Timeline seems fast based on initial info but he didn't give me specifics
 They just got a round of funding this month
 interesting
 I would have liked to ask him more questions but he had to go
 I did my research, had a nice 3 page doc of research and talking points
 thats good
 good luck babers
 i heard you were talkin bout your thesis
 Thanks huns
 Oh yeah he was asking about logistic regression models
 That's what my thesis was based on, roughly
 aw
 Natural light
 Like the beer?
 <Media omitted>
 That's my moms main purse
 I like pearl grey and ecru
 Ask vaidu
 I'd get the grey
 Good guy Bruce
 I think she's a-napping
 Or maybe ecru bc it matches that hardware better
 I dunno
 Ecru looks pretty cool with the orange detail
 I like pistahio and pearl grey too
 Pistachio won't match
 I think I'm gonna get the pearl grey
 Okie
 I like the way it contrasts with the color on the insidr
 ðŸ‘ðŸ¼
 Oh yah that's gorg
 Get her initials bro
 can i come home
 or are u gonna be lame and working
 I'm done lol
 I have been watching weird YouTube videos for the past hour

 Oh ok. I'm sorry to hear. Anyways you ready for the week?

 Hi
 http://i.imgur.com/C1eJ5TB.gif
 So I heard you were also invited to Lupis lake house on the 10th
 Yeah. My work summer picnic is also scheduled on the 10th tho
 Oh. You gonna go to that bro?
 I was thinking about it bro
 Could always go up after the picnic is over
 True
 Why don't u do that?
 I told Emily I'd go up that weekend.
 Would you wanna come to the picnic with me?
 I have mixed feelings about it
 You don't have to come if you don't want to
 Lol thank you Huns
 I want to be there to support you. But I don't know if it's the best idea for me to be there
 Why not?
 I mean most people are bringing other ppl, and the event is pretty casual
 But if you don't feel comfortable that's totally fine
 Bc I easily anger and ur job is always a touchy subject
 http://thepointsguy.com/2016/08/chase-sapphire-preferred-vs-chase-sapphire-reserve/
 You see the new chase card?
 Yes it looks cool
 At volleyball
 GOOD LUCK WITH UR ITNERVIEW CALL ME AFTER LOVE YOU
 Thanks hunns will do
 I gotta lotta questions for the underwriter
 <Media omitted>
 so i told beata/sas/vaidu about it and beata wants to give u a tip
 "Always say ur language agnostic"
 "People love that shit"
 Lmao language agnostic
 I thought that was only something that described IDEs like jupyter
 'The world "agnostic" is derived from the ancient Greek for "don't know".'
 I realize the phrase doesn't mean that, but I can't help but love the irony of telling someone you're agnostic
 lol
 beata also said stalk ur next interviewer on linked in and social media
 so u can engage them w/ their interests
 I've been stalking them already
 That's not a bad idea
 lolol good
 Find out they're into paddleboarding or something
 yeah beata is a beast when it comes to getting ppl to like her
 Just casually mention that I went the other day
 lolol
 exactly
 gah

 That's what that back room is for
 Sweet
 We should go bro
 Lolol
 YAS
 I'm trying a sample of a mask and my pores ðŸ˜­
 <Media omitted>
 O hey there
 U look like you should be on the cover of some movie poster babers
 So determined
 I bought two new shirts from old navy also
 Gray and black ones
 Lol
 How original
 Grey and black
 I know I'm so excited :D
 I actually saw this really nice looking Heather red shirt and another royal purple one but I couldn't find one in my size
 All XL and xs
 So next weekend were joining Beata and her friends for Labor Day weekend
 Which means I might be hanging out with stelios ðŸ˜
 But I just kinda wanted to get out of the city lol
 U wanna come up to vermont wif me?
 It's okay I already made these plans. I know you just wanted to be with ur friends it's cool
 It's okay bro
 I'm surprised that beata hangout isn't taking place outside of NYC
 Huh?
 It is outside of nyc. It's somewhere upstate
 Oh okay I sort of thought you implied the hangout would also be in the city
 No I meant I don't want to hang with stelios but I also wanted to get out of the city
 And since we're seeing Emily and company the weekend after
 I figured it would be the lesser of two evils
 I see I see
 Maybe it won't be that bad?
 Hopefully not
 ðŸ˜•
 I miss you hunns
 Can we do something just me and u soon pls?
 I feel like we haven't had that in ages
 Won't be until the 17th
 I know I know
 So I think I'm gonna rent a zip car to go up next weekend. That way we can just leave when we want without having to worry about dealing with other ppl
 That's a good idea
 You should check standard rentals as well depending on how long youre gonna stay
 It's so expensive gonna be like 200 pp for the two of us to just rent
 I think standard rentals are better if you have them for a few days in a row
 Oh nm that's strange
 Yeah I'll check
 I get 30-40per day with standard rentals but I might get discoints
 All my discount codes are blacked out for Labor Day
 What do u use
 We're getting 150/day for any car
 Via various different websites. We're gonna see if we can borrow Franny's car lol
 Lol
 I'm grabbing my car from my momma
 Franny's gf needs the car on Sunday and Monday lol otherwise it could have been ours
 Baby remember when my nips split open and bled? Well I'm running and it feels like that all over again ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜³ðŸ˜

 ðŸ˜—ðŸ˜—
 Lmao ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜
 ðŸ™ŒðŸ½
 So are you gonna bring snacks
 Lool
 No
 So I took a cab that was right outside hoping I would make the 730 train
 And?
 The guy tried to take me to Penn station
 Wtf
 I'm sorry hun
 I stopped him when we were on 6th I'm like where are you going guy
 So I'm not making my meeting this morning
 Oh no! I'm really sorry
 To hear that
 Is it a huge deal?
 Idk
 I'm five minutes away from heading out myself
 Roads are pretty busy rn
 Well at least I know never to take a taxi/uber to grand central
 Even if he had gone the right way it still takes at least as long as the subway
 :( did take u via the tunnel?
 It was 30 bucks fare too. He stopped the meter when he realized he took me to the wrong place but it'd be more
 No he took the Williamsburg bridge
 Damn that's why
 Tunnel only saves 4 mins
 Costs 6 bucks toll
 It's been only 20 bones for me tho
 I'm sorry :(
 I'm making myself poop on the train for this
 ðŸ’©
 Im still in the cab bro
 It's been 45 minutes
 Gah :(
 I guess I'm waiting for the 830 train
 At least you can grab coffee? And maybe poop in a coffee shop?
 Lol
 Well in its bathroom
 Just right on the counter
 I'm really sorry baby. You'll be here soon don't worry. Thanks for seeing me I know you didn't have to
 O
 Aww hunns
 So my credit card is also ruined
 ?
 The ticket machine tore up the side of it somehow
 DAMN CABBIE
 u know what I'm going to be right near u lol
 It was the MTA ticket machine
 Damn MTA
 I don't think I get service in here
 D'aww. Well I hope you have a good day and a happy poop and a great interview. ðŸ¤—ðŸ’©ðŸ˜˜â˜ƒ
 Thanks babers ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜â˜ƒ
 lemme know how it gooooes. they're gonna love you and your beard which is now smooth and not frizzy
 GOOD LUCK
 He had to push the meeting again
 It's 1:30-2 now so at least it's still today
 lol it happens
 good luck
 Ugh I think I messed up
 noon I'm sure you did fine!
 He wanted to leave after 15 mins
 noon*
 It was so saaad
 Nooooon
 tell me what happened! he might have been busy
 He was for sure
 I think I had too much coffee
 what happened? talk me thru it
 He called at 126
 So I gave him the quick summary
 He asked me about how it might relate to credit risk modeling
 I told him
 Then I asked him like 1 question about the company
 okay. and?
 And then he was like, thanks, if you have any more questions reach out to manik
 sounds like he was busy. i don't think u did anything wrong.
 I wanted to have a quick pitch ready and I wiggled it
 wiffed*
 Lolz
 Vaidu also agrees w/ me
 Well I'm off to the hundred other calls I pushed to the side
 Maybe CEO is super busy and doesn't have time if he missed it the first time and kept pushing it the second.
 I think if I don't get this I'm just gonna sign up for bit bootcamp
 thats a good plan
 Sounds like he needs the official seal or approval to hire someone but doesn't have the time to fully interview
 I should not have waited until 1230 to drink Willoughby's
 I am a wee bit shaky
 its ok
 I just called Jesse and let him knoe
 I'm proud of you babe, I'm sure you did fine. just write your thank you note and reach out to the recruiter guy.
 what did he say
 He said yeah just send thank you and wait and see
 If the news is not positive he thinks maybe we can do a redo on a call but we'll see
 thats good. you have jesse in your court. i wouldn't worry about it.
 question: is the only reason why u think u bombed it bc of the time?
 I'm deliriously tired right now. like my body just aches and is vibrating.
 Aww
 I feel you bro
 But as much as I can bc I do not have special lady time
 lol i don't either right now.
 well, cramps coming and going but I'm used to them
 http://i.imgur.com/OcGb35H.gif
 Lmaoo

 My pillows smell like you
 It's so nice
 So im walking by TOBYS and there's this doggo outside
 And I recognize him. He's from my building
 ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¼ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¼
 ðŸ‘‹ðŸ½
 I'm on da metro norf
 ðŸ˜ðŸ˜—ðŸ˜—
 Are you ok?
 ðŸ˜˜â˜ƒ

 Oh I see
 Dam son

 Who will I share dank memes with if ur gone?

 I love you too hunnies
 Btw I just heard the best luric
 Lyric"
 "yeah, I'm the shit; I should have febreeze on me
 I mean, he's not wrong
 Whatcha gonna strategize about
 What song is that from
 Some trap song, just on my Pandora workout playlist
 Just gotta figure out my next steps for getting a job
 Oh ok. Well let me know if you need help.
 Thanks huns
 Dude were already on 278
 Now we just gots to wait for our stop
 This is so convenient
 It's not bad
 Now I wish I had a car in the city
 Eh idk dudr
 It's not that hard to get where u need to go
 Well visiting my mom for dinners would be so easy
 Visiting you
 Takin road traps
 U knows
 Id have gotten a cheaper apt of I had a car
 I gotcha
 I'm home already
 And I bet she'd appreciate trips like this more
 And I don't have to worry about the grand central nonsense
 Yeah I mean
 Probably part of the appeal of Astoria / slightly further out in brooklyn
 Parking is a bit more available and you can still take the train in
 Tougher commute though
 Yeah but i wouldn't wanna travel an hour to work each way
 Might as well live in Stamford
 Exactly but now it's not like Stamford is any cheaper
 Yeah you just get a house
 Or I guess it's cheaper if you live further out like where Emily is
 True
 Just go on house hunters and get a nice 3 bedroom in Westchester county
 Lolol
 Why are we hgtv ppl
 Just go with it babers
 Honestly tho it's not like there are a lot of amazing shows on network tv
 Bob's burgers and like maybe one or two other ones
 lol I've heard great things about the night of
 But that's HBO
 Yeah that's different I guess
 And a few shows on Netflix
 Idk
 Yup, and those are like binge drinking
 2 days of chaos
 Lolol
 Then you kinda stay away for a little bit
 So they renewed stranger things for 2017
 Looool
 Wanna skype ðŸ˜ðŸ˜

 ummm
 look at this linkedin email i got
 Hey Arundhati! We're currently rounding out our leadership team and your experience in product development, management, and technology was particularly interesting. As a marketplace/ SaaS startup, I think your background would be extremely relevant. If you're available to meet early next week to discuss our Product Director role, I'd like to get breakfast or coffee.
 .....bruh
 its for a company that is in textile manufacturing i believe.
 do i say yes? do i say no? i mean......i shouldn't just ignore it right
 Interesting
 Idk I would investigate whoever sent it first
 its the CEO of the company
 http://makersrow.com/team
 I'm just very confused.
 Eh go for it baber
 See what they have to say
 okay. thats what i thought.
 woah the new iPhone announcement
 super mario on the iPhone 7
 what in the world
 but the tweets here are hilarious: https://live.theverge.com/apple-iphone-7-launch-event-live-blog/?_ga=1.85481753.1897991874.1472828213
 so now i have to stop by and see my mom on sunday
 so i guess I'm spending fri night/sat w/ you
 sat night at the lakehoues
 and ill go home on sunday then back to nyc
 i don't want to! :(
 but i guess its fine
 Damn that sounds annoying

 U sure you want to run around so much?
 no i dont
 but Vaidu will have the car so it won't be that bad i goes.
 i guess*
 dunno.
 i have to be home for lunch
 is what Vaidu said
 like why am i even going to the lakehouse then
 lolol pokemon go is coming to apple watch
 I'm just annoyed but i guess what i want doesn't really matter
 I'm just going to leave it and go with it
 I'm really annoyed right now
 and this is how i get stressed.
 Aww hunnd
 It'll be alright
 im so stressed now
 ðŸ˜•
 i want to cry
 oooh the good stuff is on now.
 ios10 and the new phone

 wtf
 wait no, it doesn't that was just a  zoom in? idk whats going on.
 wait no it looks like an iPhone. so pretty and shiny
 Now I have a headache and just want to cry
 Thanks, mom.
 That's confusing
 But it sucks
 Nonetheless
 What's confusing and what sucks
 Hi can we Skype tonight pls
 Hey give me a sec
 Ok
 <Media omitted>
 ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¼so I slept pretty well and i woke up without an alarm at 6:30 then again at 7:15 and I'm still exhausted.
 Aww
 I guess you shoulda stayed up from 630
 I made that mistake today
 lol
 BUT I SEE YOU TOMORROW
 SO ITS ALL OKAY
 ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€
 ðŸ˜—ðŸ˜—â˜ƒ
 ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜
 Babe is this for real? http://m.imgur.com/gallery/k4dd8
 idk what I'm looking at
 Ppl are implying there's no audio jack or that it's not a standard jack
 still don't get it.
 http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/iphone-7-headphone-jack-the-story-so-far-1324866
 The new iPhone doesn't have an audio jacl
 new iPhone doesn't have an audio jack
 Jack"
 Lol
 yes
 and?
 Why bro
 bc to make it thinner they had to get rid of it
 So no headphones?
 u either get wireless headphones which connect via bluetooth
 get their new headphones w/ the lighting jack
 OR u get the 8$ adapter
 I'm betting the next years version will have wireless charging so this is just the mid-step to that
 Lightning jack probably has the fastest charging capability atm
 Just seems terribly inconvenient
 it feels like an incomplete phone relesae
 but they are saving the cool stuff for next yr bc its the 10th anniversary
 <Media omitted>
 Seems about right
 Baby
 http://m.imgur.com/gallery/gD8XM
 omg
 i waaaaaaaant
 hiiiiiii
 my meeting went well
 how are you
 im bored
 I'm doing alright bro
 Been wading through issues with this model all day

 Lol probably working on said model
 What are you up to bro

 packing and laundry
 and maybe a run

 What do
 You mean?
 <Media omitted>
 I don't want to be upset at you. Can we talk about it
 i made an 8:15 reservation at tarry lodge for tonight
 not sure if you had it made or not, i don't think you ended up making it
 I didnt, but that's good
 If you get here around 6 I was thinking we could go to a wine bar for drinks and then to heirloom
 I had a reso for 8
 ooh
 that works as well :)
 yeah whatever works I'm open to anything, we just have a reservation in case
 :D
 Okay well now we have options (:
 can we go run tomorrow if its not super hot?
 maybe in the morning
 before we start the day
 For aure
 I don't think either of us is playing Pokemon go anymore but they released a new feature
 Where you can run with one of your pokers and it gives you candy for them
 oooh
 thats interesting
 lets do it bro
 Okay
 Do you wanna come to my apt to drop stuff off/change before we go out?
 I'm basically all changed into what i'll be wearing tonight, i packed light
 i just have my stuff, i can leave it int he car or at your apt. doesn't matter to me.
 Okay
 I can make that work
 I checked around for events tonight but the only name I recognize is a ska band playing at toads place
 :)
 Nothing at the Schubert
 thats fine
 we don't need an event
 Okie
 I made myself a French press this morning
 I'm buzzing like crazy right now
 It feels like it's been several hours since we last chatted on WhatsApp
 lol
 its been a few minutes
 so dunno what to do about bday
 *sulks*
 Aww babers
 U wanna do a trip up to Hamptons or my?
 NY* ?
 ooh
 so we have decided
 fright fest on the 22nd
 w/ saskia
 then i found this i wanna do next weekend:http://www.house7a.com/
 and we're doing girls night next friday
 Oo seems pretty cool
 To both of the above
 I've never been to fright fest
 and then we want to do sleep no more again for halloween
 untz untz untz untz
 That was fun
 Make sure it doesn't conflict with Emily's thing, I guess
 ugh
 lol
 her halloween party?
 :\ i guess we can go that friday night
 Lol I know man
 We don't have to go to her thing tho
 It's her favorite holiday but that's like saying my favorite pizza is pepperoni
 It's everyone's favorite
 lmao
 oh.
 look at this.
 http://milkbarstore.com/main/classes-2/
 doesn't that sound fun?
 so i think the plan is to do this the night before on 21st night (friday), then do fright fest on saturday
 That sounds like a ton of fun
 riiight
 and then get Vaidu a really nice gift
 after her shitty year
 That sounds like a good plan
 can u help me out
 i found a great bday present for avid
 Vaidu
 but not sure which tickets to get
 http://www.ticketmaster.com/resale/0000509ACD0697DE
 do u see the pic of the stadium?
 what is  better - middle of concourse 1 (aka would be 120's)
 or first row of the next step up?
 http://s1.ticketm.net/tm/en-us/tmimages/venue/maps/ny1/69683s.gif
 I was thinking 120s? There are some decent ones on 121 and 122 for like 160
 i can't find the one in 122
 i don't want to do the ones on the side, 121 and 131
 There was 123 for 170ish
 Idk what you wanna spend on this tho
 Prob a higher one isn't too bad
 But a low row
 i see one w/ this view for 200
 http://aviewfrommyseat.com/photos/emmmyhw-20150201192307.jpg
 is that too much/
 last time i paid around the same
 and i know this would be a complete surprise for Vaidu and something she would LOVE
 and after her year, i think 200 is fine, right?
 Yeah I feel like that would be pretty good
 we had set a limit of 150 for each other
 its oct 7th
 (Rescheduled from her sept 7th tour date)
 For a concert I would really wanna do something in the lower level
 Oh neat
 oh shit i can do that
 for under 220
 but in the back
 select the section as "floor seating"
 I would do the 100s
 I mean
 yeah
 bc then at least you are at an angle right
 ?
 i think thats where we were before, and it was cool
 instead of being on the floor and we are short so we might not even get a good view
 Yeah
 oh.
 section 128, row 9
 seats 6 and 7
 for 211
 ugh now i am second guessing not the floor seats
 nvm
 Nah dude I think the front ones would be good
 ok
 vaidu knows
 she guessed it when i asked her if oct 7th was free
 Lmao
 her first response was "thats the beyonce concert"
 awe okie i feel like i just did a good deed
 *nods*
 ðŸ˜Œ
 Btw, are you in NYC still?
 Just want to know when I should plan on being ready
 Yeah I'm going to gc now
 Am on 522 train
 Okie
 ILL BE THERE AT 6:50
 I REPEAT 6:50
 How so early??
 It says 707 on the schedule
 Conductor said 7pm when I asked him
 And I'm building in 10 minutes for you
 Oh okay
 Well I'm moving quickly
 At Bridgeport now
 I'll be outta the house in a few minutes
 This train goes directly from Stamford to bpo

 Also it sounds like I'm going to Virginia this Thursday. I'm gonna look into flights but it might mean I can fly out of JFK
 Okay
 Lemme know
 Dood
 I'm booked, just sent you my itinerary
 I saw
 What were you thinking bro
 About what bro
 Oh idk why u sent it to me
 Because I'm coming in and out of NYC and so I would most likely stay with you this weekend?
 That's my biz
 That's what I was asking.
 The flights were a day apart and we already had agreed that you weren't coming down so you could have easily just gone up to new havers
 I did not want to assume
 so you gonna stay....all weekend?
 I mean yeah I thin so
 ooh yay
 Maybe I will go up on Sunday afternoon or something
 But yeah if I'm travelling this week already it doesn't matter
 okays. whatever you want to do
 Might as well make it so I can see you if I have to go all the way over to va
 awe
 ur so sweet
 ðŸ˜¬
 lmao.
 lmao baby.
 Le mao
 I'm so tired of travelling tbh
 It's been every week for a couple months now
 yeah, i know. that sucks, but hey man at least you got yourself some points.
 I wanna just plop one weekend and sit around my house
 Yup
 you can do that this weekend!
 And some JetBlue miles
 you can come see me thursday night
 and go up on friday night
 if you wanted to be in ur place
 Nah nah we should hangout
 we don't have to baby
 i know u miss ur apt
 Unless you want to be on your own this wknd
 nope, i just want you to be happy
 Aww
 ðŸ¤—
 You're sweet
 hehehe
 oh so funny story
 ?
 we had our final best buy appointment today
 to fix the tv
 Lol
 they had ordered the antenna part that was broken
 and had to come fix it
 can u guess what happened?
 Did they have to reschedule?
 apparently the other times they came and we were like bro wheres ur COI and there like whats a COI...the technicians were supposed to call their managers and have their managers start a process to get the COI.
 i guess they all had a shitty job for a reason, bc no body did that
 so this dude comes in
 doesn't have COI
 and were like WTF
 but
 Wtf is a coi
 he calls his manager, starts off the process. best buy has a guarantee thing of fixing shit by 30 days
 Like a fish?
 yes
 we need to bribe our doorman with sushi
 You should really demand a replacement at this point
 its the certificate of insurance
 And some free swag
 You literally just got that tv
 anyways, bc they have this 30 day guarantee thing and they clearly dropped the ball multiple times
 You shouldn't need a coi
 our apt needs it
 for any work to be done
 ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘
 even if its like painting
 or fixing the faucet
 but the thing is....we knew this ahead of time. and we told best buy when we made the appointment.
 so they were aware of it.
 they were just lazy.
 anyways, this dudes manager who Vaidu spoke to was like oh I'm so sorry blah blah
 Smh
 so they will end up prob replacing the tv
 we were CC'ed on the email from repair dude to his manager
 and got repair dudes card
 to follow up w/ them.
 so hopefully we can sort this out soon.
 BEST BUY WARS EPISODE 6: THE SAGA CONTINUES.
 Jesus man
 If you had a car, just lugging the damn thing back would've been the way to go
 IKR
 What a bummer
 You'll have a working TV eventually
 OMFG
 GET THE HALAL GUYS CHICKEN AND RICE BRO.
 BUT CAUTION: RED SAUCE

 Perhaps a solid month

 Yes pls

 Well you won't be therw
 I'll prob cook a veggie dish on friday

 u can go get some good stuff from whole fooooods
 It's gonna be hard to find decent food these next couple days
 Airports are not known for being particularly healthy places to find foods
 oh. newp
 but JFK has a nice selection ho.
 tho*
 Neither is suburban Virginia
 Yeah I imagine so
 i can't help you in VA
 My lunch and breakfast are catered so I guess it's just dinner tonight and dinner tmmr that I gotta contend with

 <Media omitted>
 ^me sitting at my desk rn
 WHY
 WHY ARE YOU EATING THREE
 you need jesus
 and a salad
 Lol I made them a little smaller
 sure sure
 I just want to get rid of them tbh
 i'd have frozen them
 I'm not gonna be around this week
 not gonna lie
 lol
 Let's be honest, I'm not gonna defrost and eat those
 and / or you could have used the marinated beef in a chilli
 I froze four pattiea
 Nah that beef is just for burgs
 OR made a bolognese
 I DO WHAT I WANT
 Man today is not going my way
 wha happened
 Ended up missing my train by like 30 seconds cause a co-worker kept trying to keep me for one more quick thing
 Im at the next one but it rained on my walk over
 awe babers
 And it's gonna be tight me making my flight
 yikes thats tonight huh
 Yup
 :(
 Boards at 930
 why did you leave so late?!
 how are you getting down to jfk?
 Train n subway
 I was supposed to leave at 430 but my coworker made me miss it by 30 sexonds
 ok.
 well, good luck babe
 I was checking and it is apparently quicker to get there by subway than by taxi from gcs
 Thanks
 I'm gonna need it
 are you on the train now?
 Just boarded
 ohhhhhhh
 did u make it
 is this the train u wanted to make
 It's supposed to get to gc around 730 but they tend to be a bit late
 No I wanted to make the 430 train
 oh
 and u missed that by 30 seconds
 Yes
 They come pretty infrequently
 sorry i was thinking this was to the bus home for some reason. train is much better scenario.
 It is
 But it's still a bit iffy
 If there's a big line at JFK I could be in trouble
 you gotta cut it then and be like oh so sorry my flights due very soon
 :\
 i hope you get thru babers
 I was but he kept stopping me for 20 seconds at a time
 I will hopefully be fine
 oh no i mean the line lol
 stupid coworker
 Oh lol
 Yeah I bought the even more speed with jet blue
 ok good
 I should be able to bill that out
 I won't have time to get food for sure tho
 Hopefully I can grab a water at gc, I forgot to bring one with me and I'm already thirsty af

 Taxiing

 Airplane mode
 See ya later bro
 I'm very annoyed by vaidu right now. She has all day to gym but she chooses to gym when I'm going. Really dude?
 And she keeps asking me these stupid ass questions
 I just can't
 Are you here yettttt
 Sushi?
 I just had the most amazing poo
 TOBYS!
 literally like medicine
 im so happy and a tiny bit jelly
 Yeah man
 It was easily 2 days worth of poop
 loool
 im so happy for you
 I still have some more in me but I feel significantly lighter
 WEIGH YOURSELF BRUH
 WHATS THE POINT IN HAVING A SCALE IF YOU CANT WEIGH YOUR PRE AND POST POOP BODY
198
 YASSS
 like 198.00?
 I don't know if it was accurate tho
 No like .6
 ugh STOP BEING A WUSS
 oh
 so you lost....idk i can't maths right now
 Like .6 poinf
 Pounds
 That's definitely not right
 It was A LOT of poop
 three days worth?
 i'd say probs
 thats a normal poo for me bro
 Lol
 hey
 how is vaidu
 Good?
 She just left for the gym
 Why do you ask
 she mentioned she hasn't heard from saad
 and asked if she should reach out
 saskia mentioned that she thinks he is ghosting her out. hajj has been over since the 11th.
 eid is over.
 if he wanted to contact her, he would.
 i think sas was a bit harsh, but she's just worried and thinks that avid waiting around for saad to reach out is unhealthy
 vaidu*
 I suppose
 i dunno whats your take?
 would you go 5 days without any communication if you were accompanying your dad somewhere knowing that you chose him over me and knowing that we'd probably break up after?
 I really don't know. I'm not going through what he is, and I don't think I communicate like he does
 It doesn't seem like it's going to work though
 Is he back from the trip?
 I feel like his dad probably would have done something significant during/after the hajj
 He's done with hajj
 But dunno where he is
 Seems like it would be symbolic for his dad for one reason or another
 No idea
 thank you for being awesome babers
 this whole thing w/ saad has made me appreciate you and everything that you do (and all the bullshit you don't do) even more.
 i love you
 Aww hunns
 I just try to be a reasonable dude
 (and if you ever pull this shit on me i will feed ur balls to you)
 Nothing too special about that
 I love you too hunns ðŸ˜…
 loool
 hehehe
 how was lunch? i had a veggie pizza and one slice made me super full \o/
 I haven't had lunch yet
 O_O
 how do u ppl live
 I'm hungry
 ðŸ½ðŸ½
 omg go have a  spoon of almond butter to hold u over
 is very good
 we have chicken too if u want to make a sammich
 No thx
 Vaidu got back from the gym so I'll probably see if she wants to eat once she gets out
 lol
 she needs to be in the city by 4:30 i believe
 but you guys might be able to grab sweet greens
 before she heads out
 Oh I see
 I'll just ask her when she's out I guesz
 Are you coming back before you go out?
 yup
 and i think so i wanna see you bro
 Oh I see
 but i also want to try not hose damn gucci loafers. WHY DO I DO THIS TO MYESLF.
 ?

 I think she's in her room
 Just knock on her door
 What's the sushi place you were talking about before?
 It's delivery only
 Ya

 I think mizu? Not sure
 Sumo****
 It's sumo
 And also I found an article that says ako is good but I cannot personally vouch for it

 Pad Thai?
 Green curry

 Lmao
 Qi thai
 Ooh

 Yeah I hear you
 I've been waking up early to chill before going to work and switching my workouts to after work
 It's so nice in the mornings
 I've successfully done it only once

 so i came up with this email
 to include sas in our email
 Hi! 
















 *Historians often make this distinction that Oct 26th has the same amount of #blessed as Oct 22nd per capita, but since there are two holy births on the 22nd vs 1 on the 26th, Oct 22nd comes in as the holiest day.
 i am on a roll
 ðŸ˜‚
 i am funny baby
 laugh at me
 LAUGH
 Lolol
 So good
 i should have written that kim karashian line

 I may have bought a ticket already so I'll have to monitor my card
 Ok bro
 Lemme know
 Okie

 Worse case scenario I could give an extra ticket to someone who decides to join later
 <Media omitted>

 130 round trip JFK to rdu
 Oh nm blackout dates btw Dec 16 and Jan 4
 Yeesh
 lol
 10-11 is good!
 might be too much
 10-11?
 hrs of sleep?
 Oh sleep
 *pats head*
 Yeah I'm that out of it
 Dude I've been feeling like this since Monday morning
 This is a problem
 sounds like an issue
 don't take any stimulants
 and pass out tonight
 also the west wing is really fcking good
 I need to work dude
 Got some serious deadlines approaching
 lol
 ok then friday
 so u can pass out properly
 Lol ok
 i was having monitor resolution issues
 and the tech guy said that its bc my resolution isn't the native resolution
 and thats why i'll have problems.
 does that make any sense?
 i have it scaled back
 Yeah
 That makes sense
 but like, my screen flickering black kind of issues?
 really?
 What's ur monitors aspect ratio
 idk 1400x something
 That's resolution
 how do i find it out?
 Aspect would be like 4x3 or 16x9
 oh
 idk
 but like, i don't want my icons and stuff to be that large
 Whatismyresolution.com
 idk why the monitor wont work properly if i make it smaller
 Idk if it works properly for multiple monitors
 2560x1440
 its only one monitor
 i don't have mutlile
 That could just be the setting u have it on
 aspect ratio is 16:9
 setting? what could just be the setting?
 i don't understand why, with expensive monitors, i cant customize it without having issues
 that doesn't make any sense to me.
 I don't know much about Mac displays
 its a dell
 my monitor
 Are u using a Mac OS with the display?
 yes
 but why would that matter
 The Mac's video card and os are the ones configuring the data to be displayed on the monitor
 Idk much about compatibility
 It's probably fine but I would use the resolution that requires the least amount of calculation on the monitor end
 The video card on your MacBook can handle it most lilely
 Unless it's damaged
 the native resolution makes the shit on my dell huge like i have a reading disability
 and cant afford glasses
 but if i change it apparently the monitor cant handle it
 and i swear that no-one else's is this large
 so i don't understand why im being told that its wrong and to expect a monitor to malfunction.
 isn't technology supposed to make ur life easier?
 lol
 I don't get why the higher resolution would make text n shit smaller
 Or other way around sorry
 its scaled
 Higher resolution=small text
 system preferences > displays
 Don't scale it as much?
 im working on a 1280 x 900 now
 800*
 Baby that's so low def
 no, it looks fine
 That's the resolution that our 10 year old projector at the office forces us into
 <Media omitted>
 Is that small for you?
 <Media omitted>
 That's large for me
 <Media omitted>
 That's normal
 But it's scaled down
 Yeah dude
 That monitor is not good
 It's old af
 Or it's low end
 It's apparently Jons favorite
 Which is why we have it
 I want my Mac one back
 Never had problems with that
 You just gotta go with native on this
 but its huge
 Scale it down if you can
 thats the last pic i sent
 i did scale it
 but then i have issues
 -____-
 i just want a working monitor
 The highest res isn't 1080p
 with no issues
 I would just do that to give it the benefit of the doubt
 If it's still giving you black screen issues the monitor or the video card is bad
 Or you need a firmware update
 you would just do what
 Just try the native res for a day or two and see if you still get black screen issies
 but its too big
 *Rips out hair*
 i wont use my monitor if im forced to use native res.
 <Media omitted>
 Using native res now
 aka not using my monitor
 Life sucks bro
 yes it does
 im so frustrated right now
 Lol baby just do it for the vine
 Aka do it and get more black screens
 ur not being funny right now
 And then tell ur it guy that its still not working and u need a new monitor
 Oh huns I have a really dumb email question for you
 Do you use Microsoft outlook?
 yes
 Do you use folders to organize your emails?
 i use gmail
 Oh nm
 i use folders
 I was gonna ask
 How do u folder
 I'm finally at a point where I get too many emails to just have the one inbox
 i have lots of folders and auto routing set up
 based on products/projects
 I wanted to figure out the auto routing
 I wasn't sure if was a learning algo or if you had to set up specific keywords
 Or if you just had to manually sort shit
 you set routing rules
 I imagine Gmail has a learning algo but idk about outlook
 outlook does too
 you're way behind the times
 i had it all set up at blk
 routed to whichever folder
 worked 99% of the time
 I don't see anything on learning algo for folder sorting
 I only see these rules
 You set rules
 Idk where ur getting learning also from
 Gmail has one
 It rolled it out first for primary vs social vs promotion
 Idk how advanced it has gotten since
 NLP bro
 Do I need to build one
 Idk dude
 I just used rules in outlook
 It's too concrete for me I thin
 I have overlapping teams for projects and they don't always label emails with the project route
 Yeah I mean u can layer them
 And have keywords in the body of the email that will route
 Instead of the title
 I did
 It got like 75% of the emails
 aha
 yeah i dunno im sorry
 its pretty easy for me bc i had diff teams w/ no overlap
 but now im going to have to use the learning algo
 here
 Oh I see I see
 lunch today was good bro
 blistered shishito peppers
 cous cous
 beef kofta
 grilled chicken
 and a beet salad
 which one do u like
 <Media omitted>
 <Media omitted>
 first is leather
 second is leather but shearling lined
 w/ memory foam
 omg stupid engineers. i had to rush to get something done.
 *fist pumps*
 did u know that in addition to dolphins raping, apparently ducks gang rape other ducks?
 and are gay necrophile
 I didn't know about that second part but yeah duck sex is like 95% rape
 Shits crazy
 Lmao
 Baby why do u know so much about duck sex
 Should I be worried
 Omg I'm so tired
 But Vaidus drunk
 So I'm getting her food
 And then hopefully passing the fuck out
 Look it this

 Before hand
 To make sure you are on time for your show, join us for the $65 two-course pre-theater menu (including hors dâ€™oeuvres and an amuse bouche) available between 5:30-6:30 PM.
 is that what you saw?
 No actually
 Is that from betony?
 http://www.betony-nyc.com/
 yah
 Nah I chose betony separately based on infatuatuon's top resto list
 But that works pretty well
 ooh
 yeah lets talk when we get backs
 Sure
 i moved our res to 5:45
 Should that cover it if the show is at 8?
 well they open at 5:30
 so we can push it back till 5
 lol
 Lol I see
 5:30*
 we can even move it to fri
 Yeah we can
 I was sorta thinking one of the days we should go back to the west village tho

 On another note, I'm so hungry already
 Super ready for thaifoodfriday

 We got on the bus randomly while walking to a taxi

 Hunns would you be interested in going to Ikea today?
 I need to get that little table thing for my router and I've just been looking at little tables
 Sure
 Can we stop by and get a coffee from somewhere first
 Oh yeah of course
 It doesn't have to be right away
 http://m.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/art/70320017/
 This is my top contender at the moment
 http://m.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/art/90278588/
 I like this one too but it might be too big
 Where would U keep it
 It's gotta be in the kitchen
 There's only the one DSL plug
 So it'd be on the wall near the pantry
 In the kitchen?
 Yep
 U can't wire the wires over to the table u already have?
 I mean that wire would not look good being snaked around the kitchen or the living room
 You'll see what I mean when you're here
 I'm still at this oil change place waiting for my car huns
 A likely story
 "Oil change
 "
 Idk if I'm gonna be there when you get to the train station
 "Car"
 If you don't wanna wait for waters or coffee you might wanna grab it at the station
 Yeah I mean I figured
 When will u be there
 30 mins?
 I seriously don't know
 I've been waiting 50 minutes so far
 Well my phone is on 6%
 This is the longest I've ever waited for a freaking oil chsnge
 And I don't have ur keys on me
 So ðŸ¤”ðŸ˜
 ðŸ˜•
 I'll be in the station, come get me whenever
 Ill let you know as soon as they're done, hopefully it won't be long
 It's only about 10 minutes from the station so if they finish in the next 15 minutes you wont have to wait
 Ok ok that's cool
 They just finished, I'm leaving now
 Ok
 I'm waiting by the back I'll come out when I see u

 Doesn't he have a life
 It's high holiday season for him so I think he works extra so he can avoid using PTO

 Blaming me for everything
 She didn't study for her interview or prep "oh that's cuz she tried to prep with me last night but I wasn't having it"
 Her dress was wrinkled "oh that's cuz she put it on the dryer but did it on air dry/fluff cuz that's what I told her to do"?
 Omg kill me now pls ðŸ˜£ðŸ”«
 Mind u she's using all my interview shit for this interview bc she didn't prep anything until I got home
 My leather binder thing. My dress. My blazer. I mean I helped her out with that and gave her quick words of advice
 Did she need me to hand hold her through it all then when she didn't communicate that just blame me for everything that went wrong this am?
 I didn't say anything to her so I'm basically telling you instead but holy crap that's annoying
 
 ok i spoke to her about it
 also i threw out my steamer so opinions
 should i get a steamer or an iron or both?
 the set of 2 will be 30 bucks
 might as well right
 Hey, so my phone freaked out on me last night, I shut the dang thing down so it would stop freezing
 It's looking better after a restart and a charge

 23 minutes, quickest I've made the trip from your apt so far
 Lol prob
 Basically, if I drink anything in the morning I need to poop like 5-10 minutes adter
 It's one of those things man
 so we both can get ready and poop in a timely manner
 bc i missed my poop window
 :(
 and now its stuck in the ahem...shaft? hallway? idk what to call it
 Aww
 Sorry huns. You got one jammed up in the chamber
 its ok, i think we just need to agree on a sched

 i b'leve so
 Looks f'miliar

 Hey huns, got a question for you
 Are you gonna be in NYC on the monday/Tues after Halloween? The 31st and 1sr
 sure
 yes i shall be here
 Okie
 i have nowhere else to go
 i can see if i can wfh one of those days
 I wanted to make suure
 if you're gonna be here to spend some more time
 im assuming you're flying out the 1st
 and thinking then you can just stay here?
 Well I got that trip and my pm doesn't want to spend the night
 wtf
 thats odd
 so whats the plan then?
 I can take a 555am flight out for this meeting and fly back in the afternoon but I'd have to do it from LGA
 I think I could probably stay the night in DC if it makes sense for me but idk if it's worth it
 jeez
 I'd just need to be up at 4-430am to make the flight
 im assuming going the night before isn't worth it
 Which.. ifk
 ?
 Maybe
 like fck that noise
 I'm gonna keep looking but it's surprisingly cheap
 4?? are u shitting me
 Yeah cos I'd have to get shaved and into a suit
 yeah
 id keep looking esp if you're billing them
 And flight is at 555 so 30 mins to get in to lga
 Well okay if I don't fly in on Tues morning I'll most likely have to be up in time to pick my pm from the airport when he lands
 Btw I have been on the train 40 mins
 Already had 2/3 cakepops
 lmao
 baby
 stop urself
 have some self control!
 I did no have any bfast
 lmao aww
 well now u diiid
 Lol ya
 I won't be in new havers till 145ish
 ooh
 then cake pops it is!
 Lol yup
 do u have ur cake /w u
 bc i realized if ur driving down
 u should just take it back next weekend
 when u have a car
 to transport it
 Lol I have my cake
 I'm gonna be at work just in time for the post lunch crowd
 Slash pre weekly staff meeting
 Ppl will enjoy my cake
 Probably some ppl will eat enough to vom cake
 That's the dream right there
 hey make sure u get beata the stuff she wants on u
 i forgot to remind u before lol
 Yeah gotta get that done
 I kept getting busy with work junk this week
 I don't like my hair
 I don't feel good with it
 What did I do
 ðŸ˜­
 Baby noo you look so pretty
 You'll get used to your hair
 It'll be a pain in the ass to adjust but you can do it bro
 I want to cry
 I would like to give you a big hug
 :(
 no-one is understanding my plight
 hows the cake bro
 It was pretty goood
 I left it out for ppl to try but so far no one has tried
 omg sas is being such a bitch right now
 awe
 did u email out "i brought cake!"
 Lol no
 ....
 we usually email or slack "bought cake!"
 or something
 so ppl know
 But our office is smaller than yours and the cake is in the one place everyone has to stop
 Literally impossible to miss
 even at blk we did it
 You had a massive office
 Ours is like 1/5 the size of urs
 Just that one floor
 oh
 i was talking about just inter team
 like between 20 ppl
 but i guess you know best
 sorry to suggest anything
 Lol it's okay
 But yeah there are 12 ppl in the office right now
 They all saw the cake
 They know.
 then idk what to tell u
 but will be a shame if it goes to waste
 I'll just keep it in the fridge At work
 I'm not bringing it home
 lolol
 u don't want to gain 20 lbs?
 shocking.
 I'm so curious about the cake
 Did someone start eating it
 <Media omitted>
 Lmao
 Have some nice how is it
 It's good apparently
 I had a piece myseld
 A sliver one
 yummy
 not too much frosting?
 I liked it but tbh I like the cake balls better
 the cake is really sweet but the flavor is addicting as fuck
 No but I think if I had put the 2 scoops on the top it would have been
 how much did u put
 its beautiful tho
 even that pic u sent
 looks amazing
 It actually got a bit dry from having been in the freezer
 I think it was worth the class
 We can always go online n get dat recipe
 oooh
 And, y'know, maybe go easy on the frosting
 :)
 yeah i really like it
 we can even do 2 layers
 Yup
 good times
 so update: apparently saskia is too scared of me to talk to me face to face
 i think i said something in the group chat she didnt like and then just started coming at me like crazy. then starts texting vaidu being like wtf is wrong with aru is there some problem i don't know about. and when vaidu was like ....u should talk to her sas is like oh im scared of her
 What?
 You guys just hung out yesterday
 Idgi
 yeah
 this was over me being sad about my hair
 i said something and she just couldn't deal w/ how critical i am of myself? idk.
 idk dude
 but i thought that was funny
 that she has a problem w/ me but wont just tell me so we can hash it out. she'd rather just ignore it instead
 ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜
 apparently i have changed since vaidu moved
 Hope it works out for you hunnz
 and she didnt want to say anything bc <insert some bs excuse here>
 She prob doesn't understand the context or something
 ðŸ˜ðŸ˜‘
 its the weirdest thing
 why throw it in my face now while arguing instead of telling me that ur concerned?
 And after a pretty lengthy talk about how were new Yorkers and are pretty confrontational by nature
 But I mean maybe it's tougher with friends bcos you're more concerned about their feelings
 omg i didnt even catch that. ðŸ˜‚ she was telling vaidu this, i just had vaidu tell her to talk to me
 ðŸ˜¬
 Also I gotta say
 Audrey has some pretty great comedic timing
 omg i love her.
 she's hilarious
 She could srsly have a (admittedly less lucrative) career as a comedienne
 hahaha ill let her know. yeah, she's hilarious, its great
 Yup
 Oh
 I almost forgot
 <Media omitted>
 Not sure if I've mentioned this to you before, but I kinda want to have a dog as a pet
 lmao
 no you've never mentioned a dog before
 Well, now you know. It's been on my mind, not sure why
 So weird, right?
 ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬
 yeah, definitely odd. :P
 but forrealsies -- how happy were you when u walked on the elevator and then the pupper got on too
 Haha baby you don't even know
 He came up to me and nuzzled for a sec trying to sniff me
 His owner pulled him away and I was like "nah it's fine I don't mind"
 On the inside I was like PUPPEERRRR
 lmaoooooo
 the owner was probs like "get away from the crazy man"
 Is this how people get with babies?
 yes
 this is how ppl get with babies
 Huh
 lol
 did u just realize this
 Lol I've sort of figured but I've never asked anyone who's been like this with babies
 Mostly because I don't really know anyone like that atm
 awe :)
 i think its cute
 i saw the dog then i saw you and i was like oh boy
 Lool
 i bet that was a fun elevator ride
 I didn't get to pet the pupper because I was preoccupied with something
 But otherwise it was pretty great
 awe
 Is it normal to have occasional daydreams of a house out in the country with fields n shit and a loyal doggo?
 But I mean with good wifi and access to restaurants and good produce and shit
 depends, what are you wearing in these daydreams
 lol so specific
 ..not flannel?
 am i in these day dreams
 or are you alone
 you and doggo vs. the world
 Well I have a beard and an axe in these daydreams
 then why are u not wearing flannel?
 More and more I'm thinking this daydream is just from some men's fashion ad
 ðŸ¤”
 lmao or the paper towel label
 Either way, I'm pretty sure I'm just remembering some advertising now
 Well I guess I added in the access to wifi and shit
 lolol
 no more panera soup for you

 I'm serious. Don't come this weekend.
 I love you babe but I can't help you with this
 It really sucks when you make everybody around you miserable because of something like a bad haircut
 You can leave at any time.
 You're being an asshole to everyone because of this and you need to chill bro
 I'm gonna get back to work.
 The door is right there, you can leave at any time you want. I'll stop talking about it and how I'm feeling, but if you can't just be there for me because this is really upsetting me then I really don't know where that leaves us.
 No babe, there's a difference between talking to me and telling me how you're feeling and being a complete dick because you're feeling bad. What you're doing is hurting me and I wish you understood how you make me feel when you get so pissed off at everything when something like this happens
 I always want to hear how you're feeling and I'm always gonna want to help, but you have to take me into consideration too
 Don't not ever tell me anything because you think it makes me feel bad. Just maybe consider how the way you handle bad situations is making people around you feel
 I still love you and I still wanna come down, but I also want you to treat me with respect
 I'm sorry that I'm making you feel like that, but I don't think you're fully understanding how badly I'm coping. I know to you this is just a haircut I have and you think I'm just being a big baby about it but it really sucks when this is the lowest I've felt since I can remember and you don't want to hear it. I'm sorry I don't have the mental capacity to think of you and take your feelings into account. If my handling this is bad and I need to step back and consider others, I don't really think I have the ability to do that right now.
 yo.
 so beata is ready to look for external candidates for junior data scientist
 she said theres an open rec on her team and theres a similar rec on another team
 she said to send you: "Course list, programming experience, any database, data modeling  experience, level of proficiency in statistics, General career aspirations for the next 5 years"
 no need for cover letter yet
 Hey
 the info she wants can just be int he body of an email, etc. nothing formal, just for her to consume
 I'll do it tonight. Haven't done anything but work since Tuesday but I'll fit it in
 she is writing the rec now, ill send that over as well once she has it
 Okay
 i just created another group in WhatsApp
 Cool, cool
 :) *thumbs up*
 <Media omitted>
 ðŸ˜
 Dat tail wag at the end tho
 ðŸ˜ðŸ˜
 so i didnt need a shower this morning
 bc i got one on the way in to work today
 :(
 ðŸ˜•
 Didn't realize it was supposed to rain
 yes
 we might cancel fright fest
 and do museum instead
 Museum could be fun
 ikr! how was the rest of ur night
 did u stay up super late?
 It sucks that it's probably gonna rain on the day of ur birth tho
 I couldn't, I tried
 :\ i dont wanna nag but did u send beata her stuff yet?
 i know she's gonna ask lol
 I worked another 30 mins on my thing for beata and then I ate and sat on the computer
 No but I've been shirking responsibility at work to get this thing done
 :(
 I probably put way more effort into this thing than she's thinking
 i dont think its super formal, just a small write up. idk if that makes it easier on u or not
 Lol it looks like a report atm
 i think it was just a few paragraphs lol
 Oh god
 just send it
 you over acheiever
 It's 5 pages long right nos
 And it's not done
 what are you writing
 a novel
 a memoir?
 So I started by listing my stats courses but I realized they are not at all self explanatory
 So I wrote descriptions of them
 Then I wrote some stuff I did at work but that needs some explanation
 oh
 i see what u did
 So then I was putting down databases I worked on and I figured, fuck it lets go with the theme
 aww
 im proud of you but im finding this slightly hilarious.
 And so I have a short paragraph of explanation for everything including my experience with coding langua
 I had it in informal bullet form for a bit but I figure that I should at least show beata upfront that I'm a gd professional
 lololol
 baby
 i love you
 Also I don't want it to look sloppy if she shows it to anyone elss
 but something
 :\
 Lol but something
 what on earth
 sometimes***
 Yeah she probably will not expect what I'm gonna send her
 omg
 add a table of contents
 lmao
 Can I send to u before I send to her
 Hahaha
 sure
 I almost did
 Not even kidding
 your 2 masters are showing
 id be like *writes paragraph* done!
 Lolol
 you're like....*writes thesis*
 Well I also worked on a report yesterday that went out in the afternoon
 The hardest part is writing that paragraph on what I wNt to do tbh
 yeah
 So far I have ultimate goal of leading a team of ds ppl
 Start by working at becoming a subject matter expert in the primary focus of the company
 you should say something like leading a team of data scientists to influence product/company strategy or some shit
 Step 2: ??
 step 3: profit
 ðŸ˜¬
 like ur ten year goal can be start a company u know
 I mean it is
 but ur 5 year goal is to work for a corporation to become a subject matter expert leading a team to blah blah blah
 u know get ur name out there
 and get expereince
 influence strategy and vision
 and then once u have lots of ppl that are like hey this jimmy character is amazing
 then u can get investors and do the whole company thing
 Okay I just sent it
 Lemme know what u think
 It's only 3 and a half pages
 i like it
 throw career goals at the top
 Okay
 besides that i like it
 i'd send it
 w/ ur resume
 then let her know in that chat
 i think this is perfect actually, now u have that
 oh
 write at the tpo
 top
 what your degrees are in
 masters and undnergrad
 before you list coursework
 so she knows the proficiency level
 Lolol
 I need to add another section
 My pagination ðŸ˜³
 whats that
 Lol it's a word for how the body of a document looks around the page breaks
 ohhh
 i thought u meant the name of ur section is called my pagination
 and was ocnfused
 Like if you have bad pagination you'll have a paragraph break lile 2 lines in
 Oh no no
 Aaad I added page numbers
 Okay done
 shake shack for lunch
 the chicken is really good dude omg
 Yeh its kind of amazing for a burger place
 Btw
 What do you think of this laptop
 HTTP://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/11e-series/11e-yoga-3rd-gen/
 I'm thinking for a laptop I can bring around on trips and also for my dad as a Christmas present
 It's on sale for 279 on woot today
 website is still loading
 gimme a min
 its ok
 im not a fan of the swivel
 prob wouldn't want it for myself
 http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2490391,00.asp
 i'd pass on it for myself
 Yeah idk
 I'm on the fence now
 I've more been looking for my dad than for me and I'm a bit worried 11 inch screen is too small for his eyes
 it is tiny
 i have 13" and its small
 I might wait till black Friday to see if something better comes along
 honestly, i'd pass
 Yeah I think I'm gonna pass
 I like it for travel but it won't do what I need it to for my dad
 Also I guess it's not that useful for me

 Daww
 I would be in bed if it weren't for me needing to cook my chicken
 I'm so tired idk why
 Did u wake up in time?
 Eh close enough
 I'll be to work before 9
 I'd have been there earlier but I ended up mixing my chicken salad and cleaning all the dishes
 Took a lot longer than I thought it woild
 Lol
 When did u wake up?
 Like 715
 I didn't sleep well tho
 I think I'm getting sick again
 i would recommend sleeping next to a furnace
 I agree
 Now where will I ever find one of those?
 idk but when you do shower said furnace with gifts
 Lolol I just saw this
 Sounds like a good hypothetical plan
 did u send beata that thing
 ?
 i haven't really spoken to her all week lol
 I sent that stuff to her before I left ur house on Monday. Haven't really heard from her since then tbh
 This week is going to be bonkers
 I'm gonna be working 8am to probably midnight every day
 Bit of good news though, the meeting next week in Virginia got cancelled so I don't have to travel out on Monday night
 oh
 thats goo
 good*
 the 8-midnight sucks
 I am well aware bro
 I'm getting sick ðŸ˜· *cough cough* I've got the black lung *cough cough*
 Vaidu is also sick
 ðŸ˜·ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜·ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜·ðŸ˜­
 Aww
 We probably got it from going out on sat
 ðŸ˜·ðŸ˜·ðŸ˜·ðŸ˜žðŸ¤’ðŸ˜µðŸ˜‡
 Bro
 Should I work out today?
 I don't feel great but I'm kinda thinking it's only gonna get worse towards the end of the week
 I'm passing
 Mostly bc I'm lazy lol
 But I can't really breathe normally
 So ...
 I worked out. It was really tough but worth it
 Also I accidentally discovered an amazing recipe
 Chicken salad (shred chkn, pepper, salt, celery, craisins if ur a badass), romaine lettuce, pickled banana peppers, couple carrots in a warm wrap with sriracha
 It's like white dude bahn mi, it's crazy good
 Add a little cilantro and a bit of ginger dressing and it'll be even more auth
 Woah
 That sounds so good
 I'm taking my chicken wrap game to the next level babers
 I've never been prouder
 I'm sick
 ðŸ˜ðŸ˜­
 My tonsils are touching and they hurt
 ðŸ˜·ðŸ˜•
 I might just wfh
 I showered and changed and am still tired and exhausted and sick
 I would've taken today off if I could
 I shouldn't but I feel Horrible today
 Just to rest
 I have back to back meetings
 ok im wfh. i showered, etc and couldn't do it
 i even took dayquil
 and im so tired and exhausted right now
 hey babe, this weekend i might just stay here. u wanna do a weekend seperate so we can rest n chill?
 I was kinda thinking that's what'll end up happening
 If I feel better I could come down but it does not seem that it'll be the case by friday
 Yeah if I feel better I could come up on Saturday
 But as it stands now
 That's a laughable thought
 I got groceries delivered for under 2 hrs for 8$ extra fee
 That's awesome innit
 That's not bad at all
 Gonna make some chicken n some lasagna
 Nice
 So I don't have to cook when I'm feeling shitty
 I got my salads for lunch and my white guy bahn mi for dinner
 Of course everything's at work
 I'm not on DayQuil yet cos I don't have sinus pressure yet
 But I can feel it creeping
 Oh I got my gilt order today
 I haven't tried them on yet but I'm gonna tonight
 ooh
 tak pics take pics
 yeah i feel like a truck hit me
 ðŸ˜µðŸ˜‘
 I just wanna sleep bro
 lolol
 me too man, me too
 <Media omitted>
 <Media omitted>
 My first lasagna!
 Ooh looks good
 I thought it was a Sicilian pizza at first
 300 cals a slice, i used whipped cottage cheese instead of ricotta and you cant taste the difference
 has lots of veggies too
 â¤
 i need to make this for you
 and the cheese is only at the top
 Lol I can certainly appreciate a nicely crafted meal
 :)
 But I gotta be honest Ive never really been a fan of lasagnas
 I'm like the anti Garfield
 i haven't had one in YEARS
 Except that I too dislike Mondays
 but this was sauce + veggies + a lil bit of pastas
 Perhaps it is different
 maybe. i certainly liked it, but it wasn't cheesy
 it will go into my repitoire when im super hungry or dont wanna think of what to eat
 Lolol
 I made another great dinner ðŸ´
 My inner Martha stewart is showing today
 Idk why
 Chicken n veggie stir fry
 Ooh
 I'm proud of you hunnns
 Can I call u back
 I'm eating
 Sure hunns no problem
 Hey Hunnies, how are you feeling this morning?
 Hi! Im ok
 Train issues tho
 Bummer dude
 I'm feeling the same, just exhausted
 I still feel like poop lol
 Something happened to the train I'm on so it's no longer in service
 Waiting for the next one, it's right behind this one
 Omg
 Like it arrived, I got on, doors wouldn't close and now I'm on the platform again
 Ok now we're back on the train
 (On the same train)
 They announced "in sorry"
 Oh huh
 Crappy trains this morning
 ðŸ˜
 ðŸ˜ðŸ”«
 I have a Tuck MBA event  to go to with Vaidu tonight (Tuck is Dartmouth's bidness school) so I won't be back until late (it ends at 10). And this morning isn't helping. But I was able to eat bfast which is nice, so it wasn't a bad morning, I'm just exhausted right now. I didn't sleep well either, kept getting up every 2 hrs. Coffee will power me today.
 Sounds about par for the course I suppose
 I hope you feel better hunns, and good luck (?) At tuck
 My eye bags are halfway down my face too
 :/
 I take it the event is not at Dartmouth itself
 Lol
 Aww well you can use them to store your acorns for the winter

 Ended up being one large 3" polyp blocking her
 And that's what was causing everything
 Shes still groggy but she's gonna be in the hospital for one more hr or so before she gets out and goes home to rest
 Vaidu and I might go visit her this weekend and bring food
 I'm sure she's gonna be exhausted
 It's snowing here ðŸ˜¬
 Wow
 thats nice
 Yeah I hope she feels better
 might as well
 im getting sick anyways
 Glad it wasn't something really serious
 its raining weirdly here, like barely raining
 yeah, me too. greg was a mess
 I bet
 If you see her, tell her I'm glad she's okay
 Unless I wasn't supposed to know in which case don't do that thing
 nah its fine
 its major surgery
 of course i'd tell you
 text the group chat
 bro
 im sure she will appreciate waking up to multiple messages
 Any chance of complications?
 dont think so
 i just asked greg
 That's good, that's good
 he said minimal chance of complications

 83.5 base I think
 thats good
 Yeah it's decent
 whats ur overtime?
 how much of that 83.5 do u see?
 My company has this bs policy with OT that I thankfully avoid
 Probably half after taxes, medical, and 401k
 Maybe close to 60%
 After 85 base I only get 60% of the OT I work
 shit man
 But we still bill the client for 100% of those hours
 whats ur annual salary look like enow
 Umm calandar year it'll probably be like 85ish
 Year to year it'll be more like 90 starting today

 I did vote for the green party senator tho
 ðŸ™ŒðŸ¼
 Baby why
 We need the senate!
 We have a lower chance of losing the Senate, but I feel that its important to vote with your issues and to help lend credence to the idea that third parties are important and necessary to the system
 Plus the candidate has a magnificent beard
 Lmao
 Did u ask him how he grooms it
 Ok I can respect that.
 Let's hope we don't scree ourselves over with shit Supreme Court candidates

 it was good
 shots of tequila apparently give me no hangover if im not drinking anything sweet or mixing
 which is nice.
 how are you?
 and i realized i just need like 2-3 more hours of sleep for the bad quality i have when drinking, so i woke up at 6:30 and passed back out until 9 and felt fine
 Aww that's good that you figured out your system
 I'm doing well, just wfh
 Ppl were supposed to come and paint my ceiling today
 I assume they're still coming
 ooh
 good
 I'm just building a simplistic growth model for future year scenarios this morn
 oh. two important things
 1. DISHWASHER IS FIXED
 WOO
 2. A LARGE CHUNK OF EAR GUNK FELL OUT OF MY EAR
 WOOOo gross
 Debrocks?
 NOPE

 super gross
 Weird
 But good, I guess
 does your dad speak armenian?
 sas is randomly asking about your armenian heritage after she saw a pic on imgur
 and im like ....i have no idea
 http://imgur.com/rkANaSS
 No my dad is 3rd gen
 My grandpa might've spoken a little but it was either his father or grandfather that came from Armenia
 wait so ur 4th gen. so your great great grandparents came here? (
 I think so but I'm not 100% on that
 They would've come early 1900s likely to escape the genocide
 They would've been in their 20s or 30s at that point so born in 1870or so
 dang thats so long ago
 That's 4-5 generations
 they were curious why u only spoke english
 Dude my moms side I've got like 3 ppl who came on the Mayflower
 if ur half armenian
 yeah i said that
 I'm 1/4 Armenian
 yo
 oh so ur dads only half armenian?
 Grandma was polish
 Yep
 I think my grandma's side also fled genocide
 I'm one gen less on that side I believe
 jesus so man genocides
 Yeah super fun
 lol
 u know what fun
 perogies
 mmmmm
 Those are pretty freaking delicious
 is ur dad an only child
 No he had a sister
 had?
 :(
 She died a couple years ago
 They didn't keep in touch
 awe. do u have cousins on that side
 Yeah but it's been years
 oooh
 dis makes sense
 My dad didn't keep in touch with his side of the family for the most part, I honestly know very little about his side apart from my grandparents
 Even then I don't know much about them
 I think my grandma was abusive
 :o
 He's never talked about her, but I've overheard a story years ago when he thought I was asleep
 oh geez
 Yeah I know
 i think my grandpa was abusive to my mom too but thats just how it was i guess
 Damn
 Times were different then
 Mental illness wasn't really a thing you sought help for
 also ull find this funny but beata keeps saying u look like a kardashian. and so we googled what her heritage is. she's armenian but her mom is anglo something
 so english etc
 Yeah, you didn't know?
 She's got a similar cultural makeup
 well i knew but i didnt expect it to be that similiar
 now u just need to leak a sex tape with an aspiring rapper
 quick babe
 I probably have more eastern euro and less Armenian but pretty similar
 Tru, I already got dat booty
 looool
 oh lord
 give me the strength
 I'm home
 And upset and tired
 
 ii have to install plug in
 lol
 hold on a minute
 Lol OK
 I'm gonna put laundry in
 I'll be back in like 3-4 min
 ok i think its working now

 It works on so many levels
 Oh

 It's not *more* racist I guess
 Lmao

 The train is late GAH
 Ok we're on it
 Cool, cool
 I'll be at the train station in a few minutes
 If only there was a 5 o'clock train lol
 I think Vaidus a bit grumpy bc u took a later train
 I think she's just hungry
 Hangry*
 You guys can eat, it's no problem
 And refuses to eat a snack until then
 So I guess it's her own downfall
 Nah we can get our nails did ees ok.
 If you told me when you were gonna be taking the train I coulda gone earlier
 Lol baby I did
 I was just kinda hanging out waiting for you to let me know
 I thought we discussed this
 No you said probably 5
 That doesn't mean take the 4 train
 I thought we agreed upon u grabbing a 4 o'clock train
 It means you'll tell me
 No we did noy
 Oh
 Well it was not clear to me
 I thought we had discussed
 Next time we shall confirm
 You didn't give me a definite so I wasn't gonna board a train and not be able to get to ur apt
 OK cool
 Oh I thought that was my definitive
 Whoops my mistake
 Lol no man I'm not gonna just guess
 Lmao
 I've done that before with other ppl and I end up being stranded for an hour or two with nowhere to go
 No I get it
 Not doing that to myself again
 I will never be one of those ppl
 U know that right
 I know you have the best intentions but I can't
 I never know if something comes up and you have to stay later for some reason beyond your control
 Not ur fault but I don't wanna be stuck at that point
 Ok fair enough. But in that case u can just go chill in my apt. I know that's not what u want to do
 But for arguments sake I had to say it
 Bro I won't know for sure
 Well next time I'll confirm, don't worry
 We got this
 OK ok
 We got this
 And I do know for sure lol
 U can get in. Don't u worry ur pretty lol head

 The verizon thing just shows numbers and I haven't learned all my family's new ones
 So I got u swag what size hoodie did u want again
 XL OR L?
 Whenever Carolyn unpacks it she will get one for u

 Loose fitting hoodies are the way to go for lounging at homw
 I asked for an XL for u
 Thank you Hunnies you're the best

 ur eye bags are smaller
 <Media omitted>
 My work desk is messy ag
 Af*
 Aww I'm doing something right I guess
 that looks nice closed
 I actually have been making a conscious effort not to rub my eyes as much
 good! you shouldn't rub ur eyes. i have eye patches that work/really help
 Yeah I'm really happy with it so far
 at least w/ the puffyness
 Eye patches?
 and u should start using skincare, which will help not make it worse
 yeah those under eye ones
 I dunno bout those
 Never knew they existed
 yeah  its like a face mask
 but for ur eye bags
 they're cool
 i even bought you one
 I'll try it
 but u refused to use it
 :P
 Really?
 yes.
 Lolol
 im jus trying to help
 I mean you probably made it sound like we were doing masks
 nah but it feels amazing for some reason
 Idk
 its all calming and shit
 I've wanted to try those
 well, it is a type of mask
 idk what to tell u
 bro
 Well I wanted to try *something*
 I never really knew what my options were for puffy eyes
 lol u have so many
 we'll go thru them at a later date ok?
 The Google told me that I need to rest more and get fluids
 Lol sure
 well it depends why
 right
 Lol I spose
 thin skin + increased amount of blood vessels
 no amount of water is gonna help that
 u know
 but some skincare can help minimize the appearance of them / make u feel better about them
 yo so i know we spoke and you said you'd stay up for just wanted to forward the invite of hotpot with fran fran
 its on fri night too so i said u wont be here
 but wanted to just let u know

 But it was work new
 Ok  so not the super duper expensive one u bought?

 But the more expensive one that my company bought

 Least downside
 Although it means I can't wfh until I get a replacement
 Yup. With work comp I'm like meh whatever lolol

 Btw what was that beer we had last sunday
 Was it hooker winter Warmer?

 :(
 Omg went for a short run. I'm feeling a little bit better

 I hope you're doing a little better bunns

 He wanted to come up for the night
 I figured I should probably be social and hang out
 So he's coming up
 Oooh

 Really makes you wonder how many of those employees are hosts
 Or like
 Wtf is going on outside in the world
 lol yeah
 I'm on my way to werk now. I'm still so confused about what to do for thanksgiving. Francis was saying he might not stay till Friday and go back to the city on Thursday night bc Yvonne might not be able to take work off.
 I guess that would mean the three of us would leave around the same time on Thursday
 Have you talked more with your mom? I know it was kind of in a weird place on Saturday
 Not really
 I mean she went food shopping so I was helping her there bc I'm not a monster
 Lol of course
 But I still feel really weird about the whole thing
 Sometimes you gotta step away from a conversation like that for a day
 I do too hun
 I'm on board with you either way
 I told beata and she was like if I were her daughter she would be giving me the same advice
 But she agrees that my mom is going about it and the wrong way
 Idunno
 :/
 I guess I forget that your parents don't know me at all
 They knew about me for like 3 years and maybe in their minds we should have either gotten engaged by now or broken up
 I don't know
 Perhaps
 I don't get what it is. But it's really

 I agree
 Are you ok? How are you doing
 I can't imagine this is easy for you
 Still stressed n tired but I'm trying to just kind of take it in stride I guess
 :(
 If we're doing this I'll go and get some flowers from the local florist and a bottle of whiskey for your dads
 I don't know what else to do lol
 :/
 <Media omitted>
 Lol I hear you bro, I hear you
 Nice use of that pic
 Lol ty
 I learn from de best
 Daww
 Do u think this is too much pressure and we should try to do a dinner or weekend with them some other time?
 It's a lot of pressure, yeah. I feel like we need to do something soon if not now though
 If I can prove that my presence doesn't disrupt Thanksgiving I think it'll go a long way
 But I really don't know
 No I agree with you
 But idk how or when or what the timing should look like. :/
 Also since I have a three day weekend and you have a three day weekend no matter what we do let's spend it together
 Okies
 I think we're gonna be stressed out now whether I go or not
 Yep
 :|
 I'm breaking out bc of the stress dude
 Ugh also I'm waiting for the damn train for forever GAH
 Damn hun
 I'm still home reviewing a report/getting distracted every 30 seconds
 Awe why the distractions?
 Is it me
 Lol no it's me. Also this report
 Have you read 90+ page reports written by engineers? Not exactly the most engaging material
 Sounds like a real page turner
 It should be made into a major motion picture
 Starting tom hanks
 And Alec Baldwin
 Perhaps if it was narrated by Morgan Freeman
 Isn't he dating his granddaughter
 Or niece or some shit
 Wait really?
 Yeah I think she was stabbed to death but they were supposedly having an affair. It was IS step granddaughter
 His*
 I'm not making it up to
 Yo*
 Wow that's pretty damn weird
 Had no idea
 Pretty sure yeah
 Some crazy shit
 Man, it really feels like there are so few good people at that level of fame
 I'm sure it's not true but it's so hard to tell nowadays
 Yeah
 <Media omitted>
 We have stairs!
 Oh man that's cool
 Is that by the snack area?
 Yep
 Where that big construction thing was
 so i found something that i want
 thats $80
 you can either a - get it for me for xmas or b- figure something else for out under 100$
 What is the thing you want Hunnies?
 someone else is leaving the firm :|
 idk wtf is going on dude
 its an aromatherapy thing but i think i want to buy it myself
 Anything you think you need to be concerned about?
 Oo aromatherapy
 That's cool
 nope
 i just checked
 so apparently some shit went down
 bc i was told that i cant be told the full story
 but its nothing to worry about
 Oh, okay
 and just coincidental
 with the timing of the other dude that got laid off
 Seems legit
 but looks like there was some shit going on within the engineering team, and christina didnt agree w/ some decisions
 and they tried working thru it and couldn't really
 so she was asked to resign
 but im happy that when i ask ppl just actually tell me
 so thats good
 Huh yeah
 My mom keeps taking me step forward and three steps back
 ðŸ˜
 She starts with being like oh I'm sorry I upset u and I was able to articulate what exactly upset me
 Then I said something else and she jumped back and was like OMG NO WHY
 Then I had to clarify that she was taking what I meant wrong
 And now she's just calmer but also a bit upset I think
 That's... I don't even know
 Stressful
 Lol yup
 hii
 Hey hunnies
 I'm still in meetings
 Yeah that's fine me too bruh
 Lolol
 I have had a queue of 2-3 people that I needed to meet with since I set foot in the office today
 Look at u mister important over dere
 What is going on with me bro
 Lol mister important
 Babers
 ðŸ˜—ðŸ˜—
 ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜â˜ƒâ˜ƒ
 So i think I should still go to thanksgiving and meet my mom half way
 I don't think not showing up will help my case
 What do u think?
 ðŸ˜•yeah I think so
 Ok. So what about you.
 What do u think will make the best impression for u
 I can come too
 Dude idk. I think I should because we made such a big deal of it but at the same time I don't want to make Thanksgiving awkward or unpleasant for everyone involved
 If I do I can bring a bottle of whiskey and a flower arrangement as gifts
 I think that sounds good
 Let me see if I can speak to my mom on the phone and gauge her interest
 Idunno why is my family like this
 We need to figure our shit iut
 Like wtf
 Do u want me to come over for the weekend? Or u wanna come down here?
 Are u still in ur meeting? I can call u if u want
 I'm in between meetings now
 I ended one early
 I'm out but busy
 Lemme call u tonight?
 Okay sure
 We can do whatever
 I was thinking we could do my place at least for a bit
 Emily's thing is this weekend and we could go to that
 Ok
 Let's do that then
 <Media omitted>
 I feel better
 ðŸ‘ðŸ¼
 Babers

 Door to door?
 What happened
 walk to the L
 L is down

 wait for vaidu bc she's leaving in 5 minutes
 via it over because with code LTRAIN16 i get 14$ off of my ride

 Haha wpw
 I am impressed
 And yes
 Yeah that's u should probs check this more often
 I can get you a couple thousand iciclelights if you wanna replicate this at home
 Yes pls
 Can u set ur what's app alerts to actually alert u
 When I text you
 It's kinda annoying that I have to call
 ...?
 I have them on, my phone was just on vibrate
 Sure but u never respond
 Ive been going back and forth between other stuff, not been checking my phone
 I don't constantly check on it bro
 I respond as often as I can but I'm not gonna glue myself to it 24/7
 We're long distance don't u understand how important it is for u to constantly check this?
 It's not gluing urself to it. It just comes U on my phone as a normal message
 Is that not how it works on android?
 That's exactly how it works
 So I don't understand
 I'm just not looking at my phone constantly
 Idk bro. I don't accept this. anyways I'm on 1%  so I'll continue this when my phone isn't dead

 I didn't know there were multiple parts
 There were. They were great
 Oh

 <Media omitted>
 <Media omitted>
 Hi boopers I hope you're okay this morning
 Have a good day
 I love you
 I love you too hun
 I hope you were able to get some slee
 I was, a lil bit
 That's good
 What about you did you manage to sleep a little bit?
 Yeah, I fell asleep around 3 I think
 I ended up waking up at like 9 tho so I'm still getting ready for work
 I ended up just laying there in bed for 40 minutes groaning softly
 Finally got out of the bed like 25 mins ago
 Like Tina
 ?
 I watched three episodes of the west wing
 And then got up and got to work early
 Lol yes like tina
 I don't know how you do it
 I feel worn out
 lol im right there with u
 I had to sprint to the dunkin donuts to make my bus
 My head hurts
 is it balls cold outside there too?
 i had a headache coming in
 bc of the cold
 i just had toast and bc im sleep deprived my body just wants me to shove food down my mouth
 Thats the way of the body
 I have no idea if its cold out lol
 I'm sweating from my bus run
 i just had chunky almond butter
 and i could get on board with it.
 Lolol
 you'd prob like it. its so good. w/ pieces of chopped almonds
 Chunky is the way to go bro
 PB should be CREAMY
 but almond butter mmmmm chunk it up
 It sounds delicious
 I just like a little variation in texture sometimes
 As long as it's expected
 There's nothing worse than a crunch when it's only supposed to be chewu
 lol
 like if u think its sugar but its really salt
 blech
 Oh god yeah
 i want to watch the west wing while i work
 is that bad
 thats bad
 BUT I WANTS
 Lol
 If you wfh you can have both
 Speaking of
 I would like to go back home
 lol
 id like to nap
 Tru
 *snuggles*

 Hey huns, what was the site you said delivered costco without needing a membership?
 instacart
 whatcha buying
 toilet paper?
 Thanks
 Lmao
 I've been wanting to do freezer meals for a while
 Think I'm gonna try it finally this weekend
 id recommend buying these too to store them in
 I won't have to spend $30+ a day on food
 https://www.amazon.com/ChefLand-3-Compartment-Microwave-Container-Divided/dp/B00PY032QK/ref=pd_sim_79_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=H325CM509NMFHNM493FN
 u spend 30$ a day on food?
 Usually between 20 and 30, yeah
 thats a lot lol but i guess if u get delivery it makes sense
 oof. yeah
 Even if I make food it tends to get close to that
 Mostly because I buy fresh from the co op and end up not eating all the food I make
 oh yeh
 does instacart deliver to u?
 I'll find out I guess
 lol do it
 Looks like no
 Dang
 I wonder if there's any other way to get stuff from Costco
 hit up dave
 if u get a gift card
 u dont have to pay the monthly fee i believe
 That's what I've heard
 https://20somethingfinance.com/shop-costco-without-membership/
 http://www.costco.com/costco-memberships.html
 you can get the cash card
 which is the gift card.
 the yearly fee is only 55$ for the most basic membership.
 That's not terrible
 the pricier one is a hundo
 I'm not sure it would save me money in the long run though. I kinda want to see if it works out for me first
 yeah, which is why the idea of the gift card is good.
 with two ppl we def save money using it
 and u eat twice as much as i do
 so maybe u will too.
 but them meatballs bro
 and chicken nuggs
 Lmaoo
 and their food court omg. that pizza. â¤
 and i think u can buy from costco.com
 too
 I've never had costco pizza
 but they add a small surcharge
 Oh interesting
 so just for basics it might make sense to do that too. but i'd def chat dave first
 and he can help you out
 Yeah he might be able to
 He's usually in Somerville on the weekends nowadays but maybe he is here
 ooh
 so im assuming since ur making grand costco plans that you're gonna stay up there this weekend?
 I think so
 okey
 I still need to work on a whole bunch of stuff but I could potentially switch weekends
 nah
 stay up there
 and get ur stuff done
 Okay

 Sounds like last night it went well
 Loool

 Me and Jerry have a lot in common
 Also I got drunk apparently
 Lmao
 I only had one cocktail and 2 beers the whole night so I have no idea how
 And we were out from like 6-10
 What cocktail? And you might have not had enough to eat
 Lol also true
 I didn't have dinner
 Jerry bought a board but I just had like a piece of cheese
 I had an old fashioned
 They're really good at the bar we went to
 Ah that explains it
 I'm hung over now too
 D'aww
 I have a cheese hangover
 Lool
 My stomach ðŸ˜£
 Aww
 I just had a slice of pizza. ONE. And it was a medium too.
 I need to eat something ASAP

 Ok. It seems like you don't want to talk to me.
 Nah I do
 I just saw how tired and disheveled I looked
 Ok. I'm tired too but I don't make you feel bad bc of it. I don't want to make this a thing so I'll talk to you later I guess

 It's cold af tho
 Oh actually I just checked the weather and we're supposed to get some flurries in like an hour
 ðŸ˜²
 I haven't left my couch all weekend
 I'm kinda hungry but it's fun to see vaidu keep complaining that we have no food lol
 Snow starts in an hour
 Lolol
 How was gta
 Never ended up playing
 Aw bummer
 I want pizza but I should not have it
 Dude I love pizza but pizza no longer loves me
 Just thinking about those last few times we ate pizza is enough to turn me off of it for a good while
 I was gonna try a goat cheese one maybes. Lol.
 lol
 Oh damn with arugula?
 But it was so good
 Goat cheese with arugula and pears
 Weird but really good
 Thats what my mom likes to get nos
 <Media omitted>
 That doesn't sound weird it sounds amazing
 She also gets caramelized onions on it but I can no do that
 Throw some prosciutto on there
 <Media omitted>
 BRI
 THE FLESH IS WEAK
 Lolol
 You make me smile
 Woah they have vegan ones too
 <Media omitted>
 Although I gotta say I'm not sure how I feel about a chicken wrap as a pizza
 Tom hanks has his own pizza
 Weird
 I hope if you get it, the sauce is in the shape of Wilson's face
 Lmao
 WILSOOOOON
 <Media omitted>
 Is that from castaway?
 Yeah lol
 U know u can send gifs via WhatsApp now

 Lol I can't tell from the pic, but I bet it looks beautiful out that window
 That's how it looks
 Lol so not really
 U gotta press ur face against the window and stare
 Haha
 To see the random snowflake
 Well you've got a few months to enjoy the snowfall, I'm sure
 Yeah
 *Groan*
 Do you think my chili is still good to eat? I froze it last Thurs and then brought it to defrost this wed
 I'm kinda hungry and not sure if I should chance it
 Uhhhh
 Has it been in the fridge the entire time?
 Total fridge time at this point is probably 7-8 days
 With 5 days of freezer time in the middle of that
 It might be fine as long as it wasn't left out
 I'm between freeezer and fridge or reheated
 Otherwise u have some of that soup u can what up and throw the quinoa stuff in there
 Hmm yeah
 It might be okay
 I never left it out in between all that
 Smell it if it's fine it's good
 Idk what bad chili smells like
 Of it smells like rotten food
 Then it's a no go
 Press boop button to activate paws

 ðŸ˜‚I forgot about that one
 That guy is my spirit animal
 I found my coat another 100$ cheaper at Burberry
 ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
 Loool
 The hunt begins anew
 Lol not really
 It's the same coat for 765
 Ah okay
 yep. :) i still cant figure out ur second part of ur xmas present
 Daww
 I need ur present man I can't find something worthy
 lmao worthy
 apparently i am hard to shop for
 I did order a present for u already
 But its not big by any means
 We didn't go to the trevi fountain when we went to Rome right
 Its possible we drove by it to/from dinner but no we didn't stop at that one directly
 I yam in the middle of dinner bro
 i
 ugh
 :\
 i know she's blaming me. she's out of insurance
 i might have to claim her on my taxes next year
 She is your deoendant
 She depends on you now
 ok wise one
 so....i can get her on my insurance?
 Looks like probably not
 yeah
 the free market is cheaper than cobra tho for her
 so i guess thats fine then
 #stressss
 ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¼ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¼ðŸ˜—ðŸ˜—
 Aww huns
 ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜â˜ƒâ˜ƒ
 Im sorry dude
 You're saying private insurance is cheaper than Obamacare?
 It's ok. She's calmed down now so that's good
 For vaidu yes
 For families no
 Ah okay
 That helps then
 Seems like she might as well do that
 It's also cheaper for her to not have insurance and pay the penalty
 Vs getting it
 If it saves her money that's a plus
 Well yeah that's true too
 But then she doesn't have Insurance
 Up to her if she wants to not get insurance
 I mean I'm a cesspool of germs
 I would say she's probably fine but why chance it
 It behooves her to get it
 What are u doing now
 Getting ready for bed bro
 I'm tired enough for my eyes to hurt
 Awe
 Go to sleep ðŸ˜´
 I'm excited to see u this week
 I'm still feeling a bit weird from our fight last week so it will be nice
 Aww I am looking forward to it

 Set it up
 Okie

 Aw

 I'll just go to your house instead

 Somehow it's my fault I'm working late
 Oh yeah ðŸ™„
 Vaidu seems particularly I n edge this week
 On edge*
 She's stressed
 But not cool to take it out on me
 Agreed
 I just made it to 125th street so I still have another 5-10 mins
 Do you want me to meet you at work?
 Sure
 I'm still here but u might as well bc it's closer

 Ok ðŸ‘ŒðŸ½

 you need to grab the grey/purple bra on the dresser in the hallway
 and bring it to me lol
 Lol sure
 I'll have to sneak it in
 wear them as headmuffs
 I haven't heard from Vaidu today but I'm guessing she is going straight to u from her class?
 she's going to study in the starbucks up the street fro me
 and then head over when she ants to
 she said around 7ish?
 Okay
 <Media omitted>
 The sunset is bright af so it's kinda hard to judge colors on the dresser
 yes
 those are a lovely pair of headmuffs
 Lol
 So stylish and comfortable
 lmao
 such lace
 much wow
 Hey huns, I'm finishing up my work now. I can probably leave in another 20-25 mins. Is that okay?
 Or should I wait a bit longer
 You'd be one of the first people here I feels like
 So up to you
 Lols
 Well I might have to poop in between then and now
 But otherwise I can prob just head over anyways
 Lmao
 Sounds good
 Grab my rollerball deodorant pls

 So hopefully before new yrs
 ooh
 https://dappered.com/2015/01/in-review-the-j-crew-kenton-plain-toe-leather-boot/
 are you back?
 Yep, just got back
 That review was interesting btw
 I think his concerns were more personal preference
 Yeah
 Everything about quality was good tho
 Yeah, which is great
 I was actually impressed that they were welted instead of glued
 idk what that is
 but im happy you're happy
 Lol yeah I yam
 It's how the leather is attached to the sole
 i still cant believe they were sold out offing everywhere
 Cheaper shoes are usually glued
 Srsly
 i guess it was the sale + price point
 Vaidus test ends at 330 I believe
 I'm so nervous for her
 She didn't get the score she wants
 She got a 640 again
 :\
 ðŸ˜•
 I'm sorry hun

 Wish I was still down. We could have gone to get drinks or something to ease her nerves

 I missed my flight ðŸ˜³
 But is okay, I got rebooked

 did you oversleep?
 Lol actually no
 I got there exactly when I planned
 What I did not count on was an hour wait at security
 you didnt ask to cut the line?!
 Probably the longest security line I've ever been in
 Dude EVERYONE was on a 6am flight
 oh.
 :(
 About 10% of every single flight from 6-8 was missing
 Probably why the guys at the gate rebooked me for free
 jesus
 well thats a waste but that sucks you're just sitting there
 Yeah Bradley was not prepared for the holiday season
 I shoulda gone out of JFK lol
 Silver lining, I was able to do like 3 and a half hours of work
 So I use less PTO
 I had to do employee reviews, damn things took up about 2 and a half hours
 you count pto by the hour?
 Yup
 That's how my company works
 I currently have 115 hours
 I have such a weird connection to raleigg
 I'm boarding now on a flight to Detroit

 It has a train inside of the terminal
 And the tunnel to the other terminals is a light show synchronized to music
 Baby

 I can't take a pic without looking like a creep lol

 The lady directly behind me has a crazy bad phobia of dogs
 She freaked out earlier and switched her seat when another tiny dog was seated next to her
 oh. no.
 :(
 you should haev volunteered
 you're so selfless
 They moved the pupper :(:(
 :((((((((((
 Is it sad that I do not remember the lady's name but I know that the dog's name is Sophie

 Yep
 I'm horrible with names but apparently I'm great with dog names

 Should be home in a half hour or so
 What's going on?
 I'm in a mood
 This is the longest day ever
 ðŸ˜•
 I can call u when I get home
 No it's ok
 Booper I miss u
 I wouldn't mind talking just to talk
 I'm with vaidu bc parents are in her room
 I'm home now
 Can I call?
 Sure
 WAKE UP
 SUNSHINE
 Lol how can I sleep when I have 200 unread messages on whatsapp
 Lmao ur hilarious
 Put ur phone on mute
 It is
 I just happened to open the phone and on WhatsApp you can hear the little blip
 Also I've been working since 8
 Then it's not really on mute is it
 Oh why?
 Becos deadlines n shit
 I read that as bacons deadline
 I have a bacons deadline myself
 My coworker had to leave on an emergency again becos of his mother in law
 Incidentally my bacon deadline is coming up in less than an hour
 Oh no :/
 Did u read about wearing Dixie in a baby harnass to a bar?
 How far down is that one
 Because we're wondering what happens a when u show up in a bar with a dog in the baby harness
 We're TLDRing it for u
 I scrolled past a picture of a guy in a baby carrier with a pip
 So the last 3 messages
 Yeah it was around there
 Ur the closest to making this thing happen
 We were talking about children and havin babies
 
 Sorry
 Oh hello there
 Bc there was a reddit post
 That the dad to be was flipping out and being suuuuuper melodramatic
 Oh
 Yeah I clicked on that one but I didn't get to read much of it
 We went thru raising babies, nature vs nurture, ugly babies, babies in bars, puppy's in bars, ugly kids, that plastic surgery tv show the ugly duckling
 Vaidu seems a bit confrontational this morning
 Lol
 Welcome to my life
 Are babies a sensitive subject for her?
 Lol
 Sorry baber
 No I think she's trying to not make a generalization bc she knows ur in the chat and it's the one thing we disagree in
 On*
 Makes sense
 Omg this creamer in my coffee
 ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜
 The peppermont mocha?
 I haven't had any coffee today
 I brewed tea but I left the house before it could steep long enough
 I found some friends for your lamp
 <Media omitted>
 Awe
 <Media omitted>
 I got caught in se rain
 Awww nooo
 That Jane from Tarzan face
 When she gets caught in the rain
 So my stepdad is adamant about the fact that "Bill Nye is not a science Guy"
 Sometimes I forget how much Fox news he watches
 Lolol
 Whisper bill billl billl billl
 Loool
 I'll find a pamphlet about climate change and sneak it under his pillow while he is aslee
 Loool
 Does he not believe in climate change too?
 Based on my conversation with him it seems evident that's the case
 The most public interaction Bill Nye has had with the Fox news spectrum was that huge publicized climate change debate he had against that crazy guy
 Hey boopers merry christmas
 Have a safe flight out and have a wonderful time with your family
 I love you so much
 Awe ðŸ¤—ðŸ˜—ðŸ˜—
 Merry Christmas baby
 We fly out tonight at midnight
 I'll send u our travel plans today
 ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜â˜ƒâ˜ƒ
 Sanks baber
 Vaidus being moody today
 She's visibly upset bc my mom was asking her about her Harvard application
 And she just lost it
 So now she's just moping around not doing anything
 And she's just on her phone
 She's gonna just complain about this entire trip
 And be sure mopey
 And I'm not enjoying it either but damn way to bring everyone down with you
 She hasn't said one positive thing today
 And keeps sniffling and looking like she's on the edge of

 It's so frustrating omg
 ðŸ˜• yeah jeez
 Maybe if you can get her to open up and acknowledge things she'll be less mopey?
 It must be really frustrating because it's a big part of her life plan and it could be her acknowledging her shortcomings in a way
 Still though, if she's taking it out on everyone around her it isn't fair
 Like I'm 600 miles away from her and I feel like she's been combative towards me with what little interaction we've had
 I do not envy your position
 I do remember how frustrating it was when I thought I had failed my stats exit exam the second time. I just remember you were really supportive and helped me keep a positive outlook on things. I think it could help her if you say to her what you said to me
 You could also maybe cheer her up if you definitely are going to try for the GMAT and commit to being her study partner
 Sigh
 I can't wait for her to get in somewheee
 Or get a job
 I hear you
 I'm sure she's just as anxious
 Yep
 She's in an incredibly bad mood
 It's just frustrating is all I can say
 Frustrating and tense
 I'm def studying for the gmat tho
 ðŸ˜ stay strong hunnigans
 Tbh I'm just about of energy for spending time with the relatives
 The thought of spending 3 weeks with my mom and dad would make me pee myself a little
 Incidentally do you know what you're gonna be doing?
 I sent u a really hard to read itinerary
 Bombay for 4/5 days then being a tourist in the south
 Then back to north to Pune
 Sightseeing, visiting relatives, etc.
 It's a lot of time I know
 Oh wow it's pretty filled out
 Yeah bc my parents need to be constantly doing stuff or else they get bored so it's not really a vacation lol
 It's so annoying
 But my mom insists we will have time at some point to spa etc
 But I don't really see when or how since it's gonna just be go go go
 ðŸ˜• sounds like you're gonna need a vacation when you get back
 On top of that if I eat tiny portions my mom will scream at me that I'm not enjoying vacation bc I'm watching what I eat
 Bc she feels guilty eating alone
 So if we're out and she's hungry I have to force feed myself
 It's as much fun as it sounds (not a lot)
 Why are we going for 5 weeks. ðŸ˜
 3**
 Gonna feel like 5
 My mom just looked at vaidu and went "you're the only skinny person in the family"
 ðŸ˜‘
 Now she's crying
 And saying she regrets visiting us
 I don't know how to react
 It happens on a daily basis
 We haven't even left yet
 This is day 3. Omg.
 I'm so exhausted
 You call me hunns?
 Yes
 I was trying to see if my package came inand it's clooosed wash
 Wah*
 Awee
 I was not sure if you called in error
 Hi boopers I just got done with my Stuff now, figured it might be too late to call?
 Lol yeah sorry booper. I'm in the car with my dad on the way to family christmas
 I understand
 ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¼ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¼
 ðŸ‘‹ðŸ½ðŸ‘‹ðŸ½ðŸ˜—ðŸ˜—
 ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜
 I'm so done with vaidu dude omg
 She yelled at me for taking the trash out wrong
 Then said the day I clean the apartment is the day I can have a say in when she yells at me or not
 And that "I should give this to her"
 I think I'm gonna hire a cleaning lady when I'm at home
 And do it myself
 ðŸ˜‘
 Goddamn hunns
 Stay strong âœŠðŸ»
 We're on our way to JFK now
 I'm gonna give her the window seat and drink a shuttle of wine
 Shit ton*
 Sounds like a good plan
 BE SAFE HUNNIES I MISS YOU ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜â˜ƒâ˜ƒâ˜ƒâ˜ƒ
 I'm over it already
 I feel like Ima have a meltdown soon
 She's making me so miserable
 <Media omitted>

 Retail employees the world over are probably at death's door by now
 Oh wow

 Sounds like you have quite a bit of time to hang out at the lounge
 Hey man Apple doesn't support violence unless it's icepick violence â›
 Do you mean that's the only weapon or did something happen with apple and the pick?

 It's time for this guy to sneak away

 My mom has something similar and I guess just avoids a lot of food
 That sucks
 I hate avoiding food

 I wouldn't even make an old fashioned with it
 Just drink it straight
 It's sooo amazing
 Yeah you don't usually wanna mix a good single malt whisky

 No problem, not sure tbh
 I'm guessing end of ur day would be easiest for u
 I'll be at work during that time but I can find a conference room if I'm not on a call
 What about my morning
 Is that better?
 I'll be home so probably
 How many hours ahead is it? 10?

 I mean I stayed up lateish but still
 I slept 3 hrs
 That was my flight day on Tues
 I slept extra all week to make up for it
 I just showered
 Felt really good
 Nice perks

 Only regret is we didn't get a massage lolol

 Now we're waiting for my dad to finish up and we're boarding
 I'm on the second flight
 Boopers

 â˜ƒâ˜ƒâ˜ƒâ˜ƒâ˜ƒ
 So the food on this flight is a lol bit worse than the last one
 Figured
 And before we left there was a passenger who stopped the plane
 Bc she lost her luggage
 (It was put in another compartment)
 So it was up here in bidness class and she was in economy
 So they searched all the overhead bins until we found it
 It was annoying
 I've had two dinners so far today babe
 Lolol that sounds amazing
 I have had only a 1/2 cup of butternut squash soup
 And some crackers
 lol I have to land and then go get breakfast
 I don't wannna
 I wanna sleep and work out

 ðŸ
 Lolol
 I know I know I think of everything
 I've run out of things to do with my dad
 I have an hour till my mom gets here and idk what to do
 I feel like you who is feeling like Tom hanks
 Maybe you can just chill together? Like have him do his thang and you do your thang?
 Put the tv on for background noise?
 So I feel like Tom Hanks via the transitive property
 I'm just on my phone at this point but I don't wanna drain. The battery
 Does ur dad happen to have power outlets on his house
 Ye
 But I do not have my charger with me
 That sucks
 Umm just watch tv with him
 Lol I am now
 Or go for a walk and see if he wants to join you
 He's watching the news
 My dad does that too. So boring
 His hips are bad he can't walk without a lot of pain
 Aw
 Then my suggestion is out the window
 Ye
 I've talked to him about moving to a first floor apartment
 I think he needs to have surgery for them and there's no way he can walk up stairs during recovery
 Eh I'll be okay I'm just anxious to get back home

 Oh damn

 Damn that's early af
 Yes it is
 That's when I've been waking up usually
 And a pretty crunched timeframe
 We overslept
 I haven't been sleeping well at all but vaidu keeps insisting that she's been sleeping worse
 So I guess I can't complain
 But I'm just so very tires
 Tired*
 Aww babers
 I hope you can get some rest
 Yeah me too
 Oh bro I saved 20% on my car insurance today
 Switching to geico?

 That's hilarious
 But I'm pretty pumped
 I "ate" breakfast
 Ah

 Egg white omelet and half a slice of toast
 I need a vacation from Vaidu.
 ðŸ˜•
 If you have some time we should do something together
 Weekend/long weekend trip?
 We can go a lil bit south or up to ski
 A month long please
 She is so draining to be around
 Sometimes
 Dude I hear you. She is one of my favorite ppl but it's been really difficult
 Like even in little interactions I see it
 Lol
 She doesn't have a SIM card here and won't take the one I have so when I was just texting u now she made a comment "internet must be nice". And that was just "small talk"
 So I guess I can't be texting
 ðŸ˜
 Idk what to say man
 I think maybe it would be good to talk to her directly
 Be like, you are being really hurtful
 I did
 She just yells back
 ðŸ˜•
 Ideally you'd get her in a calm state? Idk man
 I'm trying, man. I'm trying.

 Random pics - 33 carat sapphire, saris we rejected and didn't buy, a church, random art posters (there's an art festival here), pic from the boat (were on the water), inside of the church, a laundry facility bc they wash all the laundry in this place (hand wash and line dry unless it's minsooning then they have these really odd looking dryers)
 The third to last pic is a small temple to the goddess kali
 We also went to a Jain monestary but we couldn't take pics there
 What are your thoughts on dating the Michelin man? Asking for a friend....
 So this is a booze less vacation ðŸ˜±
 Just had me first drank here tonight bc it's a dry state with weird drank laws
 Lol I am a bit confused about those last two texts
 But that's kinda unfortunate
 So kerela is a dry state except for five star hotels where they serve booze
 Except they don't serve on the first of each month
 So this mini vacation is more or less booze less
 Oh interesting
 I just woke up from another nap
 Feeling like I'm gonna stay away from booze after Saturday
 Lol too much?
 I'm stuck on a family vacation with no booze and soon to be no internet
 Lol yeah I was feeling not so great yesterday was
 See yeah that sucks
 Yuuuup
 I'm at trader Joe's getting food
 Vaidus up finishing her apps last minute so yay im up too bc the light is on
 Ah I see
 Lol
 Apparently their pizza veggie burger is amazing
 Poor hunnigans
 Oh goddamn that sounds goof
 Is new
 I just bought like 5 meals worth of ingredients
 Gonna do a few weeks of freezer meals as a test run
 Grab stuff for freezer too
 Oh yeah I got some of their pre made frozen stuff
 Whatcha get
 What's their new seasonal stuff?
 I got a stir fry thing, a couple of their sauces, their soups, and some meatballs
 Mmmm
 I didn't see anything particularly seasonal tbh
 Their meatballs are ok
 Nothing amazing so be ready to sauce em up
 Lol
 They have a flyer that says what their new stuff is
 Yeah I just wanted them for additions
 Ah I see
 Trader Joe's has great snacks too
 And their oatmeal packets are legit
 Snacks being pre portioned trail mix and stuff like that
 Lol yeah I haven't eaten and I'm struggling not to buy like 1000 snack packs
 They have great pre marinated meats too
 U can buy a few and be lazy
 I mostly had my meals planned out beforehand
 and decent frozen veggies
 So I'm good to go
 What meals
 So my phone died
 I got the button to work again so that works for now
 But. I ended up watching the OA. Solid show

 They're like "hey breakfast is only there until 10"
 So we woke up at 9 we're gonna shower and head up
 ðŸ˜
 Every ten minutes it's a phone call or text or someone at the door
 I finally yelled at them

 Sounds like a fun time
 My mom was sick last night she had a fever so she's kinda meh
 Oh man that does not sound good
 Beata had this weird thing this am where she told me I was super negative and she wasn't sure why she was friends with me. ðŸ˜ and I'm in day 2 of my period with white pants and a thong on. it's been a weird day man.
 It was 100.2 apparently

 I Made meals over 3 days

 Mine is to travel once a month

 And my abs are sore and my stomach still burns
 So we are staying at the same hotel but we upgraded our package so we're at the club level instead of the pleb level. It's slightly smaller spread for food but it's fresher and more customizable. After speaking to a server I realized that everything I was eating before was cooked in ghee and that's why I was super bloated.
 Vs
 Thems not just angles bruh
 <Media omitted>

 Also the pupper is now a German Shepard (we're at the same

 I was actually gonna be on PTO PTO but we are supposed to have multiple calls with clients
 Pto? What for
 You going on a trip somewhere or just wanted a day off?
 I just wanted some time off nan
 I hear ya. Stupid clients
 I didn't get to actually take time off the week of Christmas
 And I've been travelling most of the past 2 months
 ðŸ™
 You deserve a day off
 This weekend was one of 2 weekends I spent at my apt since oct
 Can u chill tomorrow or something?
 Maybe
 I also wanted to apply to jobs
 Well I am back on Thursday but will be a waste of space till Monday
 So you will have next weekend to yourself as well
 Also I talked to Alex's dad at the Nye party and he was super into helping me flesh out that idea for my own T&R firm
 Aww
 But I miss the space you waste
 Ooh nice
 Awe
 But boopers Ima be on a 10 hr jet lag
 And I have Monday off
 U should take it off too
 And we can play video games
 Lolol
 I might be able to
 I'll see
 Are you gonna be at ur hotel room soon ish? Can you call?
 I am in bed
 Ya call
 What is this magic?

 Pupper is so majestic
 Did u just wake up?
 I thought you'd like him
 ðŸ‘ðŸ ðŸ’©
 I see
 Well hopefully you can go back to sleep afterwards
 Bahahahaha
 Ur funny
 I'm hearing up dinner rn
 Heating
 Which one is it
 How do u store them meals bro
 Ziplock in freezer?
 So I spoke with vaidu
 Yeah ziplock in freezer
 What happened
 Nothin just about you heading down
 She agrees with me that we're gonna be on diff schedules the first weekend and the weekend after might be better to visit bc we'd be more like normal humans then
 But if you still wanna come you can
 It might be a lot of us napping or sleeping while you're up
 Our plans now are this: land Thursday, Friday as early as we can get out to Whole Foods and grocery shop. We're gonna try to debloat with lots of raw veg, smoothies, eating in bc we've been eating out for 3 weeks
 And just hang out. We wanna go to the movies
 No alcohol, stuff like that
 If you want to join then comeeeee I wanna see you I just don't want you to get boooored
 Lol it's cool its cool
 I might hang out with George the first night anywau
 So I would be down on sat more likely
 Ok
 Then just head down when ur done with George
 And if we're just sleeping all day you can entertain yourself lol
 But maybe your sleep schedule would be fucked up with George
 So might not be an issue lol
 Do u know yet if u can take Monday off
 I don't know yet
 I probably won't until wed tbh
 Ok
 That's fine just lemme know
 Okir
 Okie
 If you can't get Monday off then maybe just staying up in new haven't and coming down the next weekend or having me come up might be better. Let's chat when we know for sure about Monday
 New haven't lolol
 Sure hunnigans
 Cat just doesn't care

 Two moar days bro
 TWO MOAR DAYS
 U got this baber
 I bought a reeeeally purty dress
 And vaidu bought a gorg one too
 But we forgot to take pics
 The thing is a cape that stays on via a choker
 I also bought palazzo pant Kurtz suits. You might know them as pantaloons.
 Kurta*
 <Media omitted>
 <Media omitted>
 The back goes all da way down ðŸ˜ðŸ˜
 <Media omitted>
 And then a photo album of my first bday with my late grandfathers handwriting
 <Media omitted>
 (My moms dad)
 Spoiler :  I was a damn cute baby
 My grandmother also asked me when I'm having kids bc she wants to play with them. ðŸ˜ðŸ˜…
 Aww you look so pretty hun
 Also ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ðŸ˜¬
 Lmao
 I was wondering why my phone was making noises at 4am lol
 Worth it
 Lmao
 But isn't that dress gorgeous
 It really is
 That was what got tailor made for you, right?
 It looks like it was made specifically for you
 No that's off the rack
 We still haven't gotten our tailored stuff. Those are kurtas (pant suit thingies) not dresses
 Although this has pants too I'm just not wearing it
 Pantaloons???
 Yes
 Nice.
 I'm getting pantaloon sets done, the dress doesn't have pantaloons the dress has skinny mesh pant thingies. It's awkward
 Interesting
 Also boop have you ever prepared a profit and loss statement?
 Maybe
 Why
 I'm making one now as a test/sample. Just working through the soecifics
 I have been reduced to a one syllable boop now
 Aru is too much huh
 ðŸ˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜
 Lol baby you know we rarely call each other by our given nanes
 It's weird when you think about it, huh
 I've been having smoothies for breakfast/lunch these past few days. It's been awesome
 Lolol
 So I'm back at the hotel room
 Finally
 I think you're gonna like the new pantaloons I got lolol
 They're the palazzo pants
 Lol I almost guarantee it
 And damn that's late for you guys, it's almost midnight
 Dude this is normal for India bc nothing opens before 10 am
 <Media omitted>
 <Media omitted>
 I was a cute kid yo
 Damn lil baby aru
 Can u tell me apart
 To pic which one do u think I am
 This one I'm having a hard time with
 Top*
 It's ok I have no clue I just ask my mom and memorize which one I am
 I wanna say you're the one mean mugging the little one in the middle
 Lolol HOW DARE YOU
 That's vaidu
 When has she ever had her eyes open in a pic
 I know that's what killed it
 I can usually tell if u guys are both facing the camera
 That's better than I can
 I have more, I'll go thru them with you soon
 Haha nice
 <Media omitted>
 Wtf on those outfits
 To be fair I don't think I'd be able to tell baby pictures of me and Sean apart
 Why
 Oh pls I've seen one baby pic of u
 And u look the same
 As I do now?
 Bc that's up for debate
 Yes ur face
 Not baby but the one with u and ur mom and ur bro at the beach
 Baby I can say I have at least 20% more beard than when I was a baby
 Oh so
 I wanted to do a fun data analysis
 I ended up doing some EDA/NLP on my WhatsApp group chat with Dave Alex and sean
 I can accurately predict whether a given text is Sean about 80% of the time
 Everyone else less so but still, pretty decent from an average of about 10-15 words
 Ooh
 What about me
 Also I made word clouds of our chat
 Can u accurately predict a text from me
 Lmao omg
 I haven't tried
 I want to see this word cloud
 <Media omitted>
 This is me and u?
 <Media omitted>
 No that's dave
 The bottom one is total
 Omg imagine if u sent one out
 But instead of he bubble thing
 It was dick butt
 ðŸ˜‚
 I had to remove haha yeah and like in addition to normal stop words because they dominated the cloud
 What did ours look like
 Do emojis make it
 I wanted a solid multinomial dataset so I didn't try ours
 ðŸ˜
 I didn't process emojis but I 100% would have to figure out how to do it for ours
 Lmao
 BOOPER
 Emojis account for like 20% of our comvo
 BOOP
 BABY
 ðŸ˜ðŸ¤¡ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜šâ˜ƒâ›„
 I did it for u
 Daww ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜â˜ƒâ˜ƒ
 Aww I miss you
 I do have the framework done so I could probably analyze our chat reasonably quickly
 I miss you too booperator
 I jus want a hug and a green juice
 Daww I have both, I can provide u
 Yay
 Am so tired *yawn*
 Sleepy aru
 ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬
 Lolol
 I didn't wear a bra today
 Noice
 I can't wait to cuddle when I see you next
 Yay
 It would be so nice to have you warm my butt
 Haha as i do
 <Media omitted>
