353,"9/17/15, 9:24 PM ", Alex C," Changing subjects, I just gotta vent real quick about some TA bullshit. Yesterday, the professor that I TA for tried unknowingly (because her math is weak sauce) to assign me a grading load the violated my contract hours. I made an excel sheet and did basic hours accounting to prove to her that she had indeed violated it. Totally QED'd her. But now she's acting like she can still negotiate with me. I'm supposed to show my calculations to the other TAs tomorrow to make sure they agree, which as I see it doesn't matter. If they don't, I'm gonna straight go to the department head and if that doesn't work to the union if I have to. I don't get what the fuck she don't understand about contracts. Fucking academics sometimes, man... Sheeeuuuttt"

1057,"12/18/15, 9:05 PM ", Dave Wu," When I see Christmas lights strung up in the neighborhood, I don't think about Christmas hogwash. Rather, I remember the time we spelled Prudence with lights and we were the cool kids... Good times."

1224,"1/5/16, 3:49 PM ", Dave Wu, I think my coworkers are struggling to grasp my 'you need to break some eggs to make an omelette' approach to healthcare. Sometimes there's outliers and you just gotta say fuck 'em. Don't got the resources to cater to every one.

1286,"1/15/16, 3:03 PM ", james e mooradian, If you don't mind podcasts you might enjoy stuff you should know. I work to it a lot - it's light enough that you don't feel like you miss out on much by not paying attention

1338,"1/25/16, 7:06 PM ", james e mooradian, Just like those company 'about' pages that all day 'we use data integration and next level insights to produce business intelligence growth across a variety of verticals'

1396,"1/30/16, 10:40 AM ", Sean B, You need that Dijkstras algorithm brah
1398,"1/30/16, 10:45 AM ", Alex C," Yeah, I mostly worried about computation time. I will have relatively large spatial graphs and I want to couple the flow through multiple graphs, so I might need to solve them multiple times. Python's a good idea though. Probably has some parallel options"
1408,"1/30/16, 10:56 AM ", Alex C," Cool, ok, I'm going to try some options out and see what I have access too. Thanks for the infos."
1410,"1/30/16, 12:10 PM ", Alex C, I think just 2 more weeks until drinking

1487,"2/11/16, 2:56 PM ", james e mooradian, It's an employer's market man. Most places could offer euthenasia as the only provided healthcare benefit and people would still apply.
1490,"2/11/16, 3:05 PM ", Sean B, It's upsetting how poorly we treat workers in this country
1493,"2/11/16, 3:07 PM ", james e mooradian, We're pretty great at fucking over the common man
1497,"2/11/16, 3:11 PM ", james e mooradian," People working maybe 20-30 hours a week, having week-long holidays, and just generally chilling so hard"
1498,"2/11/16, 3:12 PM ", Sean B, Yeah.  European culture is great.

1891,"4/4/16, 4:24 PM ", Alex C," Butze's probably right. Nothing to lose doing that. Dave, you should give yourself some more credit for just going to the formal in the first place. That type of stuff can be so overwhelming and exhausting. How do people actually enjoy those things? It's a difficult date night, especially if you just started seeing someone. I definitely would have felt extremely uncomfortable. So definitely give yourself some credit for stepping out of your comfort zone and going at all. Takes some cajones just to be present for something like that, in my opinion at least."

2100,"5/5/16, 1:03 PM ", james e mooradian, Might as well make an entire meal from base ingredients
2108,"5/5/16, 1:32 PM ", Sean B, I can't even express how excited I am for this.  When's the estimated completion?
2117,"5/5/16, 2:21 PM ", Dave Wu, I still think we should start an artisan bread/urban garden for the homeless type charity.
2130,"5/9/16, 11:51 AM ", Sean B, <Media omitted>
2132,"5/9/16, 11:51 AM ", Sean B, <Media omitted>
2133,"5/9/16, 11:57 AM ", Alex C, Hahaha that's awesome
2140,"5/9/16, 12:04 PM ", james e mooradian, Obviously
2144,"5/9/16, 12:15 PM ", Sean B, Pics!!!
2147,"5/9/16, 12:27 PM ", Sean B, Astronaut
2154,"5/10/16, 5:44 PM ", Dave Wu, I foresee some 'on our wedding night she reached back and peeled off her face' situations
2156,"5/11/16, 12:57 PM ", james e mooradian, Oh shit I was just listening to them talk about that on NPR
2160,"5/11/16, 4:21 PM ", Sean B, <Media omitted>
2163,"5/11/16, 4:43 PM ", Sean B, I can see this becoming a thing
2164,"5/11/16, 4:44 PM ", Dave Wu, it'd make a sweet t shirt
2176,"5/13/16, 10:10 AM ", james e mooradian, Everybody knows you don't use smoked fish in sushi
2177,"5/13/16, 10:10 AM ", james e mooradian, Guy clearly belongs under that table
2179,"5/13/16, 10:34 AM ", Sean B, Lol you guys are cold
2188,"5/13/16, 4:03 PM ", Sean B, Jncos mandatory. Linkin park or staind shirts also acceptable
2189,"5/13/16, 4:04 PM ", james e mooradian, Shit I hope I can find my matching vans
2191,"5/13/16, 4:06 PM ", Sean B, Dress code: '1999 hot topic / x-games fan'
2193,"5/13/16, 4:36 PM ", Sean B, That's awesome
2197,"5/13/16, 7:05 PM ", Sean B, Oooo weeee
2223,"5/14/16, 6:00 PM ", james e mooradian, Goddamn look at that sweet vinyl flooring
2230,"5/14/16, 6:07 PM ", Sean B," To the best of my knowledge... Af = 'as fuck', as in 'cool as fuck.'  Goals is used as an adjective instead of a noun.  'This shit is goals as fuck'. 100 emoji I believe is just for emphasis.  Like 'times 100' or '100%'"
2234,"5/14/16, 6:09 PM ", Dave Wu," Also, never knew there were so many baguettes that shop at home depot Somerville."
2236,"5/14/16, 6:13 PM ", Sean B, Lol
2237,"5/16/16, 12:16 PM ", Dave Wu," Saw a rotund white girl in yoga pants jogging in East Somerville. She's like the physical manifestation of my dreams for this area. Keep jogging East Somerville, get that figure slim and gentrified."
2241,"5/17/16, 6:08 PM ", Dave Wu, <Media omitted>
2243,"5/17/16, 6:14 PM ", Dave Wu, Probably has a peg on his head for switching between hair and football helmet.
2253,"5/19/16, 2:17 PM ", james e mooradian, Wow that's pretty great
2256,"5/19/16, 2:19 PM ", Sean B, <Media omitted>
2265,"5/19/16, 3:43 PM ", james e mooradian, No idea why they're so funny tho
2272,"5/20/16, 10:20 AM ", Dave Wu," http://getremix.com Just saw this on the interwebs, not sure if it's applicable to Jim"
2273,"5/20/16, 1:50 PM ", james e mooradian, I could come up on Saturday as well. I'll probably be able to be up around 7
2279,"5/20/16, 1:59 PM ", Sean B, Lol
2304,"5/27/16, 1:02 PM ", Sean B, I'm going camping with some of Courtney's friends so I won't be around unfortunately
2305,"5/27/16, 3:15 PM ", Alex C, I'm out in San Diego for a conference this weekend
2306,"5/27/16, 4:11 PM ", Dave Wu, Well I guess I'll be solo baking loafs.
2309,"5/27/16, 5:25 PM ", Sean B, Nothing but you and the dough
2315,"5/27/16, 7:17 PM ", james e mooradian, Worst case scenario we could grab some za and drinks at bar
2317,"5/27/16, 9:34 PM ", Dave Wu, <Media omitted>
2329,"5/31/16, 9:58 AM ", Sean B, Haha yeah I thought of that.  Just like the Olympic airways video.
2331,"5/31/16, 12:18 PM ", james e mooradian, Lmao
2332,"5/31/16, 12:18 PM ", james e mooradian, That weight is judging you
2335,"6/1/16, 10:24 AM ", Dave Wu, Should try to deck out the rav4 like this dude's van. Maybe hands paint the word 'Grape' on the side too.
2336,"6/1/16, 10:58 AM ", Sean B, Damn that thing is sick
2337,"6/1/16, 11:24 AM ", Dave Wu, Pretty much my dream hustle wagon if I could confirm there's an onboard shower
2338,"6/1/16, 11:26 AM ", Sean B, Been following this Instagram lately it's pretty awesome for van stuff http://instagram.com/projectvanlife
2342,"6/1/16, 12:24 PM ", Dave Wu, And wiping. Looking at some fertile ground for dingleberries. Now that you bring up the bathroom situation. I don't think I could part ways with modern plumbing. I think I'll settle for minimalist living in a small city space.
2350,"6/1/16, 1:28 PM ", james e mooradian, <Media omitted>
2354,"6/1/16, 1:29 PM ", james e mooradian, Lol yeah just gotta commit to your small social/family unit
2365,"6/2/16, 1:49 PM ", Dave Wu, Mr PB is a long time family friend lol. There was just some awkward small talk in the break room. Um what are ass gaskets? Sounds buttstuff-esq. And they come out of a dispenser?
2373,"6/2/16, 1:56 PM ", james e mooradian, I mean technically that child isn't wrong
2377,"6/2/16, 2:03 PM ", Dave Wu, And that's one reason to air dump to
2378,"6/2/16, 2:03 PM ", Dave Wu, too*
2381,"6/2/16, 2:04 PM ", Alex C, I think just stuffing them back in. I imagine an absolute nightmare scenario for a germaphobe reaching for the protection of a gasket only to be betrayed
2384,"6/2/16, 2:10 PM ", Dave Wu, Lol. Curious how did your building find out it it was him?  Was there a memo go around about dookie butter on toilet covers?
2385,"6/2/16, 2:12 PM ", Alex C, This actually occurred at a friend of mine's company. She works in HR and it was reported to them. At around the same time there was also a mystery person leaving dookies in paper bags around the office. Separate offender who was ultimately fired once discovered.
2391,"6/2/16, 2:24 PM ", james e mooradian, Lool
2393,"6/2/16, 7:07 PM ", Sean B, Wow that was quite a convo guys
2414,"6/5/16, 11:01 AM ", Dave Wu," Despite all the hipster/yuppie shit associated with cold brew, I think there's more caffeine. Apparently I'm supposed to dilute it but drinking it straight gives the ole brain balls a nice rubbing."
2426,"6/9/16, 3:17 PM ", Sean B, Also that toilet video is awesome.  I'm sure you'll have a good poop story or two from your trip
2428,"6/13/16, 12:46 PM ", Dave Wu, When I encounter a biscotti I don't get the urge to revisit the James. It's more like damn I need to read some books and switch on the NPR.
2429,"6/13/16, 12:47 PM ", james e mooradian, Lmao
2433,"6/13/16, 12:52 PM ", james e mooradian, 10/10 would recommend with some fresh artisan loaves
2438,"6/13/16, 5:34 PM ", Dave Wu," Nice, flipped through the menu. Seems pretty reasonable. #mungojerry"
2445,"6/17/16, 8:01 PM ", Sean B, Hahahaha
2447,"6/17/16, 9:06 PM ", Sean B, <Media omitted>
2450,"6/17/16, 9:08 PM ", Sean B, I never go back to the carpet store
2459,"6/22/16, 10:55 AM ", james e mooradian, <Media omitted>
2460,"6/22/16, 10:55 AM ", james e mooradian, Think I dun goofed
2463,"6/22/16, 11:01 AM ", james e mooradian, Lolz
2474,"6/22/16, 3:53 PM ", Sean B," I think the majority of people aren't very interesting (remember uconn?) or they are playing it safe by trying to focus on widely relatable things, thinking that will give them the most appeal.  But that's actually not a good strategy.  Better to focus on specific more unique things and appeal to a smaller number of better matched people.  But it takes time to learn that"
2477,"6/22/16, 3:56 PM ", Sean B, Yeah it's all about that niche appeal
2482,"6/22/16, 4:57 PM ", Dave Wu," off topic from dating, but Sean, are you still using the 5 minute artisan recipe for your breads or are you on some next level knead formulas."
2485,"6/22/16, 8:07 PM ", Sean B, I've been using the book 'classic sourdoughs' but I think the King Arthur website also has some good ones for free
2496,"6/24/16, 2:53 PM ", james e mooradian, Pretty jealous
2499,"6/24/16, 2:55 PM ", Dave Wu, yeah definitely feel a bit for depressed to when I see Sean's pics. Makes me wanna get a tiny house and take Roy off the grid.
2505,"6/24/16, 4:03 PM ", Dave Wu, But for real I've been looking into tiny living options. Really want to amass a variety of tiny places in different locations.
2509,"6/24/16, 7:28 PM ", james e mooradian, HAHAHA
2521,"6/25/16, 12:52 PM ", Dave Wu, so auth
2525,"6/26/16, 2:48 PM ", Sean B, Nah I'm staying with friends this weekend so they had all the equipment.  Just used store yeast
2526,"6/26/16, 2:50 PM ", james e mooradian, Oh nice. Gotta keep those bread skills sharp during your travels
2530,"6/26/16, 4:28 PM ", Dave Wu, ah classic white balls.
2540,"6/26/16, 10:59 PM ", Sean B, Watch jim be dominating all of us in bread making within like a week
2542,"6/26/16, 11:02 PM ", james e mooradian, Lmao
2544,"6/26/16, 11:03 PM ", james e mooradian, Baking seems a lot different from cooking meat tbh
2557,"6/28/16, 12:14 PM ", james e mooradian," Oh speaking of tiny houses, there's an entire show on HGTV devoted to them"
2560,"6/28/16, 12:18 PM ", Dave Wu, I've thought of mortgaging a set of prefab tiny houses in a vacation type area ie Ludlow and renting then out
2561,"6/28/16, 12:19 PM ", Dave Wu, though vacation rentals is a fickle business especially with climate change.
2567,"6/28/16, 12:24 PM ", Dave Wu, So it's rebranded for the progressive folks.
2568,"6/28/16, 12:25 PM ", Dave Wu," kinda like peasant loafs, uncovered brick walls and loose hanging Edison bulbs"
2572,"6/28/16, 12:30 PM ", Dave Wu, I've been searching for this NPR segment about local grown stuff and how it doesn't solve any world problems. It's the most inefficient easy to make crops to supply an ever growing population.
2594,"6/28/16, 12:47 PM ", Dave Wu," For me balance would be society delegating resources to provide guaranteed proper resources water, basis food and shelter in the most efficient, industrial way possible.... establishing a baseline. Then amassing more or seeking creativity, personal growth is dicking around you can do on your own accord"
2599,"6/28/16, 1:09 PM ", Sean B, http://giphy.com/gifs/tim-and-eric-mind-blown-EldfH1VJdbrwY
2601,"6/28/16, 1:10 PM ", Alex C, Blew my mind too. That little piece of math that James showed me lead to a whole derivation that made the lungs thing clear to me
2624,"6/29/16, 11:23 AM ", Dave Wu, View is on the break room TV again. Not sure if I can buy into the stuff spouting out of these daytime talkshow folks. Clearly biased because Ja Rule is noticeably absent from the discussion. #jaruleforscotusjustice
2625,"6/29/16, 11:24 AM ", Dave Wu, and Sean awesome you made it to the west cost
2637,"6/30/16, 9:17 AM ", Dave Wu, <Media omitted>
2648,"6/30/16, 7:05 PM ", Sean B, I told them it means world peace
2650,"7/1/16, 9:31 AM ", Dave Wu, Fuck I'm about to straight lead a revolt.
2655,"7/1/16, 9:53 AM ", Dave Wu, I'm more concerned about the techs they get paid a lot less but hold down a shot ton
2670,"7/2/16, 2:59 PM ", Alex C," Butze, does that light whole wheat dough from the no kneading book work well for pizza?"
2672,"7/2/16, 4:36 PM ", Alex C," Nice, we're about to try out the bread oven down in Madison"
2679,"7/3/16, 2:20 PM ", Alex C, <Media omitted>
2682,"7/3/16, 5:11 PM ", james e mooradian, Dave I know it's super far for you but would you want to come over to Brooklyn for the 4th?
2684,"7/3/16, 5:12 PM ", james e mooradian," It's just gonna be me, the twins, and 4 or 5 of their friends"
2693,"7/4/16, 6:40 PM ", james e mooradian, Done did it again
2697,"7/4/16, 6:41 PM ", Sean B, We should do Labor Day weekend again this year

2745,"7/12/16, 9:37 PM ", Sean B, What app are you using to do that
2754,"7/12/16, 9:39 PM ", Sean B, A wild James appears!
2755,"7/12/16, 9:40 PM ", Alex C, Jim's expression is like 'what you talkin' bout'
2759,"7/13/16, 1:58 PM ", Alex C, <Media omitted>

2851,"7/19/16, 2:54 PM ", Dave Wu, ref.
2858,"7/20/16, 10:48 AM ", Dave Wu, Always thought the wacarnolds rib sandwich toll strategy would be best. Mileage tax just seems about as annoying as old school electric/gas meter reads.
2868,"7/20/16, 10:54 AM ", Dave Wu, yeah those no booth tolls on mass Pike are pretty sweet. Alternatives like CT fast trak? Seems like a good amount of people actually use it.
2877,"7/20/16, 8:37 PM ", Sean B, <Media omitted>
2884,"7/21/16, 11:07 AM ", Sean B, All those effing twenty somethings

2905,"7/25/16, 11:26 AM ", Sean B," Aw man I really wanna come for that.  Leaving Montana on August 1st and was estimating I'd be back in mass on the 7th.  I guess there's a chance if I activate Wu-drive I could make it, but probably not super likely"

2923,"7/26/16, 1:14 PM ", Sean B, I'll have to check
2927,"7/26/16, 1:18 PM ", Sean B, Lol probably

2971,"7/27/16, 3:28 PM ", james e mooradian, Lol yeah
2973,"7/27/16, 3:29 PM ", Dave Wu, man serves the machine that serves the cat
2984,"7/31/16, 7:22 PM ", Sean B, So grim
2991,"8/2/16, 1:02 PM ", Dave Wu, Most likely running at a loss. They'll get replaced by upscale chain. The non well heeled artsy folk and hipsters will then flock to the next cheap area.
2997,"8/3/16, 10:29 AM ", james e mooradian, Lol
3000,"8/4/16, 9:36 PM ", Dave Wu," laser disc is for vids though, so you could just set images of your junk to music... There's probably only 2 people on earth who can play it anyways."

3081,"8/18/16, 2:37 PM ", Dave Wu, Well looks like the Berkshire strain of baby pigs are not available at the nearby farm. Only got some lean strain piglets. Good news for them because I won't have to make eye with their eater.
3090,"8/19/16, 1:52 PM ", Alex C, Haha awesome. Why is 'Patriots' in quotes? Is the mascot meant to be ironic?

3603,"9/29/16, 8:25 PM ", james e mooradian," I've often thought about the revenue model for music streaming sites. With things like YouTube or Pandora/Spotify with advertisements, ad revenue can be directly tied to an individual artist's popularity. With a paid streaming service, it's that much more of an indirect correlation between popularity and sales, and you don't get a feel of an individual fan's willingness to  pay for additional goods/services/ad products. Seems like individual artists with a significant amount of fans (like Beyonce and Kanye with that whole tidal thing) can hold sway over the market"
3610,"9/30/16, 10:15 AM ", james e mooradian, Bout to make those guys like $0.02

3683,"10/13/16, 8:41 PM ", Dave Wu, Some form of porridge is big in every culture. But I think we shy away from it nowadays because of modern package breakfast foods. It would be cool if someone opened a multi ethnic porridge shop.
3687,"10/14/16, 10:20 AM ", Dave Wu, Reason I ask is because my street had a recent jump in sales with a bunch of places gutted and condo converted.
3696,"10/14/16, 10:54 AM ", Alex C," I think the same thing is happening in South Boston where my sister lives. Especially near her condo there are a number of newly converted and new build condos. Just walking around the neighborhood, you'll see a lot of people who are our age with young kids who most likely work in the seaport. Kelly has said that she knows a number of people at her work who also live in south Boston. So it could be a bunch of 'Kellys' buying up condos in Somerville"

I reminds me of when I took CS math and we were studying formal logic and my prof was saying that politics is basically all about just making logical fallacies.

4102,"11/8/16, 7:12 PM ", Sean B, Would love to see what kind of set up they have under the hood.  Gotta be a total nightmare.  Probably one copy of an MS access database on a single machine from 1995
4109,"11/8/16, 7:15 PM ", james e mooradian, I do believe that is the format of one of the 'newer' punchcsrds
4113,"11/8/16, 9:20 PM ", Sean B, <Media omitted>
4114,"11/8/16, 9:20 PM ", james e mooradian," I mean that's nothing new but now it has a horrible, horrible outlet"
4116,"11/8/16, 9:21 PM ", Sean B, Courtney's workin on her EU citizenship.  Dat backup plan
4118,"11/8/16, 9:22 PM ", james e mooradian, I could maybe wfh from spain
4122,"11/8/16, 9:24 PM ", james e mooradian, I think the eventual hope is that technology will eventually bring about lasting peace
4124,"11/8/16, 9:24 PM ", james e mooradian, I mean either way
4126,"11/8/16, 9:25 PM ", james e mooradian, Allmother will care for us
4131,"11/8/16, 9:27 PM ", james e mooradian, Just open up an artisanal b2b services platform and earn an honest living
4133,"11/8/16, 9:29 PM ", Dave Wu, Lol
4135,"11/8/16, 9:30 PM ", james e mooradian, Their current prez is like our obama
4139,"11/8/16, 9:33 PM ", Dave Wu, Haha yeah he totally looks like him
4165,"11/8/16, 10:44 PM ", james e mooradian," It's too bad she doesn't matter, I would totally get behind her if she were a serious contender"
4166,"11/8/16, 11:12 PM ", Dave Wu, Well looks like ol Detroit might be the most important place in the world right now
4175,"11/9/16, 9:18 AM ", james e mooradian, I read an article by a guy who was slamming the fivethirtyeight model because it predicted a 35% chance of trump winning
4178,"11/9/16, 9:20 AM ", Sean B, Yeah
4181,"11/9/16, 9:20 AM ", Sean B, Bernie would have done better in that demographic
4185,"11/9/16, 9:21 AM ", Dave Wu, Lol
4186,"11/9/16, 9:21 AM ", Sean B, I don't think all of them could possibly be that ignorant and hateful.  But when you gotta put food on the table that forces you to make certain choices.  Le sigh üòû
4189,"11/9/16, 9:22 AM ", james e mooradian," Nobody has given a shit about people outside cities, most of all hillary"
4193,"11/9/16, 9:24 AM ", Sean B, Yeah... Silver lining is this is going to force both parties to really reevaluate shit and hopefully we'll get much better candidates next time around
4198,"11/9/16, 9:25 AM ", james e mooradian, Legit
4207,"11/9/16, 9:45 AM ", Sean B, Well at least gay marriage was already legalized so that can't get taken away.  Feel really bad for Courtney though bc she works in reproductive health and her whole company could basically get defunded
4211,"11/9/16, 9:48 AM ", Sean B, Is that even repeal-able at this point?  I can't imagine he really opposes it. He's not religious
4218,"11/9/16, 9:51 AM ", Sean B, I think I'm gonna donate whatever proceeds I get from trump tax cuts to women's health and/or NAACP.
4221,"11/9/16, 9:59 AM ", james e mooradian, Yeah
4222,"11/9/16, 9:59 AM ", james e mooradian, Not a bad idea
4244,"11/10/16, 9:27 AM ", Sean B," Yeah... I'm definitely guilty of a few ass grabs back in the day, specifically admist spring weekend mobs"
4246,"11/10/16, 9:41 AM ", james e mooradian, I'm totally with you on needing to make a cultural change on this front. It just worries me that so many people are going to ignore the nuances to these issues in light of trump being elected
4250,"11/10/16, 9:42 AM ", james e mooradian, I worry that it's going to become very draconian as opposed to being understanding
4257,"11/10/16, 1:07 PM ", Sean B," Yeah I think the whole free trade and automation thing is similar to the problem of gentrification.  You have these unstoppable forces that are irreversible and technically beneficial for the greater society in the long run but in the process some people get fucked over.  So the question is how do you deal with that?  Libertarian view is 'too bad, adapt or die'.  The opposite extreme is to be Luddites and prevent any change or progress altogether.  Neither really seems like a good strategy"
4258,"11/10/16, 2:39 PM ", Dave Wu, It's a matter of how free trade and automation are used. Do you choose to concentrate the gains in the hands of a few and perpetuate the historical inequalities? Or do you use the current unprecedented global connectivity and ability to separate humans from labor to proliferate something that benefits everyone? Unfortunately humans are selfish and short sighted. The libertarian and Luddite views are just different sides on the same selfish coin.
